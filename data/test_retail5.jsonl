{"en_question": "[SCENARIO]\nFamily: F7 (Network and Multi Echelon)\nArchetype: retail_f7_ring_routing\nScenario ID: retail_f7_ring_routing_v3\n\n[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]\nBusiness narrative:\nLocations are connected in a directed ring, mimicking a truck route that visits each location in a fixed cycle. Inventory can only move along the ring edges, and storage capacities are tightened so that the chosen routing structure affects feasibility and cost. Demand is local and exogenous at each node, and unmet demand is lost and penalized.\n\nStructure cues:\n- The transshipment network in the JSON forms a directed cycle: DC1\u922b\u6257C2\u922b\u6257C3\u922b\u6257C4\u922b\u6257C5\u922b\u6257C1. Inventory can be shipped only along these ring edges.\n- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.\n\n  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.\n  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.\n\n  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:\n\n  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]\n      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!\n      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.\n\n  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1\n      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales\n\n  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]\n      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste\n\n  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]\n      - Can only sell what you have in inventory\n\n  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2\n      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)\n- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Capacities are scaled to 80% of normal values.\n- For each product, location, and period, inventory reflects previous stock, local production, inbound ring shipments, outbound ring shipments, sales, and waste, and must remain non-negative.\n- Demand at each location is met from local inventory and inbound ring shipments; there are no shortcuts across the ring.\n- Inventory that moves further along the route must pass through intermediate locations in sequence.\n- Lead times for ring shipments are effectively zero in this archetype, and substitution behavior is as encoded.\n- The objective is to minimize total cost (aggregating purchasing, holding, waste, lost sales, and transshipment costs) while respecting the ring network structure and tighter storage capacities.\n\n[DATA]\nThe following JSON contains all instance data.

{"en_question": "[SCENARIO]\nFamily: F2 (Assortment and Substitution)\nArchetype: retail_f2_circular_sub\nScenario ID: retail_f2_circular_sub_v3\n\n[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]\nBusiness narrative:\nThe retailer offers several products in a category where customers are willing to switch along a circular pattern when their first choice is unavailable. The basic, premium, and short-life products form a directed substitution ring, so demand may move from one item to the next according to that ring. Demand remains exogenous by product and location, and any demand that cannot be satisfied even after considering allowed substitution is treated as a lost sale.\n\nStructure cues:\n- The overall structure is still single-echelon inventory with per-product production capacities, local storage, and lost sales when demand is not met.\n- Inventory at each location evolves from carried-over stock, new production, sales to customers who originally requested that product, and sales to customers diverted from other products along the substitution ring, minus any discarded units. Inventory must remain non-negative.\n- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.\n\n  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.\n  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.\n\n  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:\n\n  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]\n      - This is ONLY the inflow from production.

These limits must be respected.\n- The substitution graph in the JSON defines a directed ring among the products. Each edge [A, B] means A's demand can be served by B's inventory. When demand for product A cannot be fully served from A's own stock, the model may serve part of that demand using B's inventory if edge [A, B] exists.\n- Any remaining unmet demand after using all allowed substitutions becomes lost sales with a penalty cost. Customers are not backordered.\n- Zero lead times remain in effect, and there is no transshipment between locations.\n- The objective is to minimize total cost including purchasing, holding, waste, and lost sales while respecting the substitution pattern encoded in the JSON.\n\n[DATA]\nThe following JSON contains all instance data.

{"en_question": "[SCENARIO]\nFamily: F1 (Core Operations)\nArchetype: retail_f1_base\nScenario ID: retail_f1_base_v1\n\n[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]\nBusiness narrative:\nThe retailer manages weekly inventory for several products across multiple distribution centers that directly serve final customer demand. Demand for each product at each location is seasonal and exogenous. Products are replenished each period up to a per-product production or procurement capacity, and any demand that is not served immediately in the period is permanently lost and penalized. Customers are never backlogged or promised future delivery. Inventory is held locally at each distribution center, and there is no movement of stock between locations in this archetype.\n\nStructure cues:\n- Time is a discrete sequence of periods defined in the JSON. Decisions about how much to produce or procure and how much to ship to each location are made at the beginning of each period; demand is realized and served within that same period.\n- Inventory evolves by carrying over what remains from the previous period, adding any new production assigned to the location, and subtracting units that are sold or intentionally discarded as waste. On-hand stock is never allowed to become negative.\n- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.\n\n  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.\n  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.\n\n  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:\n\n  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]\n      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!\n      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.\n\n  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1\n      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales\n\n  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]\n      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste\n\n  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]\n      - Can only sell what you have in inventory\n\n  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2\n      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)\n\n- Any demand that cannot be met from available local inventory in the period is treated as lost sales and incurs the lost sales penalty. There is no concept of backorders, reservations, or delayed fulfillment.\n- Production for each product in each period cannot exceed the given production capacity. Production is available without delay in this archetype because lead times are effectively zero.\n- Storage capacity at each location and period limits the total volume of on-hand inventory using product-specific storage usage coefficients and location capacities from the JSON: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected even in periods where they do not bind.\n- Substitution: Edge [p_from, p_to] means p_from's demand can be served by p_to's inventory.\n  Variable sub[p_from, p_to, l, t] = units of p_from's demand fulfilled by p_to.\n\n  Demand fulfillment equation:\n  - For p_from: total_sales[p_from] + sub[p_from, p_to] + L[p_from] = demand[p_from]\n  - For p_to: total_sales[p_to] - sub[p_from, p_to] + L[p_to] = demand[p_to]\n\n  Interpretation: p_from's demand is served by own sales + substitution + lost.\n  p_to's total sales include serving both its own demand and p_from's demand.\n- There is no transshipment of inventory between locations; each location can only serve its own local demand from its own inventory.\n- Labor capacity is set high enough that it does not bind in this archetype, but if labor constraints are included they must be consistent with the JSON parameters.\n- The objective is to minimize total cost over the horizon, including purchasing costs, inventory holding costs, waste costs, and lost sales penalties. No fixed ordering costs, minimum order quantities, lead times, reverse flows, or global budgets are active here.\n\n[DATA]\nThe following JSON contains all instance data.

{"en_question": "[SCENARIO]\nFamily: F8 (Omni channel and Store Operations)\nArchetype: retail_f8_sustainability\nScenario ID: retail_f8_sustainability_v4\n\n[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]\nBusiness narrative:\nThe retailer operates under a sustainability or regulatory constraint that limits total waste. Over the entire planning horizon, the total quantity discarded as waste must not exceed a fixed fraction of total demand. Demand is local and exogenous; unmet demand is lost and penalized. The retailer must balance serving demand, avoiding stockouts, and limiting waste.\n\nStructure cues:\n- The inventory and production structure is the same single-echelon system with storage capacity and lost sales as in the base scenario.\n- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.\n\n  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.\n  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.\n\n  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:\n\n  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]\n      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!\n      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.\n\n  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1\n      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales\n\n  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]\n      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste\n\n  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]\n      - Can only sell what you have in inventory\n\n  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2\n      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)\n- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.\n- The JSON specifies waste_limit_pct=0.02 (2%). Over the horizon, the total waste across all products, locations, and periods must not exceed 2% of total demand: sum(waste) <= 0.02 * sum(demand).\n- Inventory is updated from previous stock and production, minus sales and waste, and remains non-negative.\n- Substitution behavior remains active as defined in the JSON, and there is no transshipment.\n- The objective is to minimize total cost (aggregating purchasing, holding, waste, and lost sales) subject to the global waste cap, making trade-offs between holding more inventory, losing sales, and discarding units explicit.\n\n[DATA]\nThe following JSON contains all instance data.
