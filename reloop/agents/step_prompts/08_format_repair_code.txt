FORMAT REPAIR — CODE ONLY

Your previous output was not a plain Python script (e.g., included Markdown fences, commentary, or missing required prints).

Task:
Re-output ONLY the Python source code as plain text.

Rules:
- No Markdown, no backticks, no comments, no explanations.
- Preserve the intended logic. Only fix formatting and missing required boilerplate (imports, status printing, parameter settings) if absent.
- Do NOT introduce file I/O.
