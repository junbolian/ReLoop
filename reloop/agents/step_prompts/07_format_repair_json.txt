FORMAT REPAIR — JSON ONLY

Your previous output was not valid JSON or did not match the required schema.

Task:
Re-output the SAME information, but strictly as valid JSON that matches the schema for the current step.

Rules:
- Output ONLY JSON. No prose.
- Use double quotes for all keys/strings.
- No trailing commas.
- Do NOT add new content. Do NOT remove content. Only reformat to valid JSON and ensure required keys exist.
