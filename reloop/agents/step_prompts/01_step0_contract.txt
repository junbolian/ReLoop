STEP 0 — LOCK THE TASK CONTRACT

Task:
Answer the following 4 questions based ONLY on the scenario narrative + the data_profile provided earlier in the conversation:
1) What are we optimizing?
2) What can we control?
3) What MUST be satisfied (hard constraints)?
4) What is allowed to be unmet but penalized (soft violations + penalty)?

Output requirements:
- Output MUST be a single JSON object, no surrounding text.
- Use double quotes for all strings. No trailing commas.

Output schema (exact keys):
{
  "optimize": "one sentence",
  "controls": ["short noun phrases, decision levers"],
  "hard_constraints": ["short noun phrases, must-hold rules"],
  "soft_violations": [{"name": "short name", "penalty_source": "which cost key or rule implies penalty"}],
  "contract_summary": "one sentence summarizing hard vs soft structure"
}

Rules:
- If the narrative says “unmet demand is lost and penalized”, you MUST include lost sales as a soft violation and reference costs.lost_sales.
- If shelf life exists in data_profile, you MUST mention expiration/waste as a hard physical mechanism (even if waste is penalized).
- Do not add items that are not implied by the narrative or data_profile.
