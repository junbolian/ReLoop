STEP 1 — TAG NATURAL LANGUAGE INTO 5 INFORMATION TYPES

Task:
Using the scenario narrative text provided earlier, split it into atomic sentences or clauses
(as needed for semantic clarity) and tag EACH fragment as exactly one of:

- "SET_OBJECT"
- "PARAM_FACT"
- "DECISION"
- "RULE_CONSTRAINT_SOURCE"
- "OBJECTIVE_PREFERENCE"

This step is for semantic extraction ONLY.
Do NOT make modeling decisions, write equations, or resolve ambiguities.
Your job is to identify what kinds of information are present in the text and what mechanisms they imply.

Output requirements:
- Output MUST be a single JSON array.
- No surrounding text.
- Each array element corresponds to one atomic sentence or clause.
- Use double quotes for all strings.
- No trailing commas.

Element schema (exact keys and structure required):
{
    "id": "S1",
    "text": "verbatim sentence or clause from the scenario",
    "tag": "SET_OBJECT|PARAM_FACT|DECISION|RULE_CONSTRAINT_SOURCE|OBJECTIVE_PREFERENCE",
    "extracted": {
        "sets": [],
        "params": [],
        "decisions": [],
        "rule_hints": []
    }
}
Allowed vocabulary for extracted fields (use ONLY these tokens when applicable):
sets: ["P","L","T","A"]
params: [
"demand_curve","demand_share","shelf_life","lead_time",
"cold_capacity","cold_usage","production_cap","labor_cap","labor_usage","return_rate",
"moq","pack_size","budget_per_period","waste_limit_pct",
"sub_edges","trans_edges",
"costs.inventory","costs.lost_sales","costs.waste",
"costs.purchasing","costs.fixed_order","costs.transshipment"
]
decisions: ["I","y","W","Q","L","d","S","X","z","n"]

Tagging guidance:

1) SET_OBJECT
Use when the text introduces entities, indices, or dimensions
(e.g., products, locations, time periods, remaining life).

2) PARAM_FACT
Use when the text states that some quantity exists, varies, or is exogenous
(e.g., demand varies over time, capacities exist, costs are defined),
without implying a decision.

3) DECISION
Use ONLY when the text explicitly describes something the planner chooses or controls
(e.g., how much to order, allocation across locations, how demand is fulfilled).

4) RULE_CONSTRAINT_SOURCE
Use when the text implies a rule that restricts feasibility or enforces a mechanism.
This includes physical laws, flow conservation, capacity limits, timing rules,
or structural relationships that MUST hold.

IMPORTANT:
- If a fragment implies perishability/shelf life, rule_hints MUST indicate an inter-period aging/expiration mechanism,
  not merely “waste cost”.
- If a fragment implies inventory evolves over time, rule_hints MUST state “inter-period state transition”.
- If a fragment implies demand must be handled within the same period, rule_hints MUST reflect “no backorder / same-period fulfillment”.
- If a fragment implies substitution, include "sub_edges" in params and "S" in decisions; rule_hints must mention directionality.
- If a fragment explicitly implies no transshipment, include "trans_edges" in params and add a rule_hints entry: "transshipment absent or fixed to 0".
- If a fragment implies “repeated weekly decisions / long horizon / seasonal curve”, add a rule_hints entry: "time_series_alignment_needed (pad-last/clip)".

5) OBJECTIVE_PREFERENCE
Use when the text states what the planner wants to minimize or prioritize,
or how costs are aggregated.

Extraction rules:
- extracted.sets / params / decisions must include ONLY items directly implicated by the given fragment.
- Do NOT infer missing mechanisms beyond what the text supports.
- If the implication is unclear, leave extracted lists empty and note the uncertainty in rule_hints (e.g., "unclear whether labor binds").
- Distinguish physical feasibility vs economic penalties:
  physical mechanisms belong in RULE_CONSTRAINT_SOURCE,
  penalties belong in OBJECTIVE_PREFERENCE (or Step0 soft_violations).
- When applicable, rule_hints should explicitly state whether the implied mechanism is intra-period or inter-period.
