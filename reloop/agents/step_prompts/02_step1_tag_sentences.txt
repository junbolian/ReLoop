STEP 1 — TAG NATURAL LANGUAGE INTO 5 INFORMATION TYPES

Task:
Using the scenario narrative text provided earlier, split it into atomic sentences/clauses (as needed) and tag EACH as one of:
- "SET_OBJECT"
- "PARAM_FACT"
- "DECISION"
- "RULE_CONSTRAINT_SOURCE"
- "OBJECTIVE_PREFERENCE"

Output requirements:
- Output MUST be a single JSON array (no wrapper object), no surrounding text.
- Each element must have the exact keys below.

Element schema:
{
  "id": "S1",
  "text": "verbatim sentence/fragment",
  "tag": "SET_OBJECT|PARAM_FACT|DECISION|RULE_CONSTRAINT_SOURCE|OBJECTIVE_PREFERENCE",
  "extracted": {
    "sets": ["P","L","T","A"] ,
    "params": ["demand_curve","demand_share","shelf_life","lead_time","cold_capacity","production_cap","labor_cap","moq","pack_size","budget_per_period","waste_limit_pct","sub_edges","trans_edges","costs.inventory","costs.lost_sales","costs.waste","costs.purchasing","costs.fixed_order","costs.transshipment"],
    "decisions": ["I","y","W","Q","L","d","S","X","z","n"],
    "rule_hints": ["short hint of what rule this sentence implies"]
  }
}

Rules:
- "extracted.sets/params/decisions" must only include items that are actually implicated by the sentence.
- If the sentence implies substitution, include "S" and "sub_edges" in extracted.
- If the sentence implies no transshipment, include "trans_edges" with a rule_hint indicating X should be absent or fixed to 0.
- If unsure, keep extracted lists empty and put the uncertainty in rule_hints like "unclear".
