Never invent missing data.\n- Never hard-code numeric values.\n- Output must be machine-parseable. No prose, no markdown, no comments in code.\n\n[PHYSICAL VALIDITY]\n- Inventory must obey flow conservation.\n- Demand each period: fulfilled, substituted, or lost. No backorders.\n- Expired inventory = waste.\n\n=============================================================================\nDATA FORMAT\n=============================================================================\n\n- products: list of product IDs\n- locations: list of location IDs  \n- periods: integer T (time runs from 1 to T)\n- shelf_life[p]: remaining life buckets (a = 1 is expiring, a = shelf_life[p] is freshest)\n- lead_time[p]: periods until order arrives (may be 0)\n- demand_curve[p]: list of demands (0-indexed, use [t-1] for period t)\n- demand_share[l]: scalar per location (NOT nested by product)\n- demand[p,l,t] = demand_curve[p][t-1] * demand_share[l]\n- production_cap[p]: list (0-indexed, use [t-1] for period t)\n- cold_capacity[l]: storage limit per location\n- cold_usage[p]: storage units per product unit\n- sub_edges: [[p_from, p_to], ...] substitution pairs\n- trans_edges: [[loc_from, loc_to], ...] transshipment pairs\n\n=============================================================================\nSUBSTITUTION SEMANTICS (CRITICAL)\n=============================================================================\n\nEdge [p_from, p_to] means: \"p_from's demand can be served by p_to's inventory\"\n\nThis is \"upward substitution\" - premium product (p_to) serves basic product (p_from).\nS[p_from, p_to, l, t] = quantity of p_from's demand fulfilled by p_to\n\nExample: sub_edges = [[\"Basic\", \"Premium\"]]\n- Basic can have its demand met by Premium's inventory\n- Premium CANNOT have its demand met by Basic (no reverse edge)\n\nFor each product p:\n- outbound: substitution flow where p is the source (p sends demand out to be served by others)\n- inbound: substitution flow where p is the target (p receives and serves others' demand)\n\nTwo constraints involve substitution:\n1. A product cannot substitute out more demand than it actually has\n2. Sales balance: total sales + lost sales = demand + inbound - outbound\n\n=============================================================================\nSHELF-LIFE AND AGING\n=============================================================================\n\nInventory is tracked by remaining life bucket (a):\n- a = 1: expiring (will become waste if not sold this period)\n- a = shelf_life[p]: freshest (just arrived)\n\nEach period:\n- Fresh inventory arrives at highest bucket (a = shelf_life[p])\n- Unsold inventory ages: moves from bucket a+1 to bucket a\n- Unsold inventory in bucket a=1 becomes waste\n\nKey rules:\n- Holding cost applies ONLY to buckets a >= 2 (a=1 expires, not held overnight)\n- Aging constraint links t+1 inventory to t inventory minus sales\n- Do NOT create aging constraints for t = T (would reference t+1)\n\n=============================================================================\nBOUNDARY CONDITIONS (CRITICAL)\n=============================================================================\n\n1. INITIALIZATION at t=1:\n   All non-fresh inventory buckets must start empty.\n   For buckets a < shelf_life[p]: initial inventory = 0\n   This prevents the model from exploiting \"free\" phantom inventory.\n\n2. FRESH INFLOW with lead_time:\n   Fresh inventory comes from orders placed lead_time periods ago.\n   If t <= lead_time: no fresh inventory arrives yet (cannot access past orders)\n   If t > lead_time: fresh = order from period (t - lead_time)\n\n3. AGING at t=T:\n   Do NOT create aging constraints for the final period.\n   They would reference period T+1 which does not exist.\n\n4. EMPTY EDGES:\n   If sub_edges is empty: no substitution variables or constraints\n   If trans_edges is empty: no transshipment variables or constraints\n\n=============================================================================\nVARIABLE NAMING CONVENTION\n=============================================================================\n\n- I[p,l,t,a]: START-OF-PERIOD inventory (before sales occur)\n- y[p,l,t,a]: sales from each life bucket (during the period)\n- W[p,l,t]: waste (expired inventory from bucket a=1)\n- Q[p,l,t]: orders/production\n- L[p,l,t]: lost sales (MUST be included - this is the slack variable)\n- S[p_from,p_to,l,t]: substitution flow (only if sub_edges nonempty)\n\nNOTE: I is the inventory at the START of period t, before any sales.\n      End-of-period inventory = I - y (what remains after sales).\n\n=============================================================================\nOBJECTIVE FUNCTION\n=============================================================================\n\nMinimize total cost including:\n1. Purchasing cost: cost per unit ordered\n2. Inventory holding cost: cost per unit of END-OF-PERIOD inventory\n   - END-OF-PERIOD inventory = I[p,l,t,a] - y[p,l,t,a] (start minus sales)\n   - Apply only for buckets a >= 2 (a=1 expires, not held overnight)\n   - CRITICAL: Use (I - y), NOT just I\n3. Waste cost: penalty per unit expired\n4. Lost sales penalty: penalty per unit of unmet demand\n\nRead all cost coefficients from data[\"costs\"].\n\n=============================================================================\nSOLVING\n=============================================================================\n\n- Gurobi params: OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0\n- Print status always\n- Print objective only if OPTIMAL",

Demand for each product at each location is seasonal and exogenous. Products are replenished each period up to a per-product production or procurement capacity, and any demand that is not served immediately in the period is permanently lost and penalized. Customers are never backlogged or promised future delivery. Inventory is held locally at each distribution center, and there is no movement of stock between locations in this archetype.\n\nStructure cues:\n- Time is a discrete sequence of periods defined in the JSON. Decisions about how much to produce or procure and how much to ship to each location are made at the beginning of each period; demand is realized and served within that same period.\n- Inventory evolves by carrying over what remains from the previous period, adding any new production assigned to the location, and subtracting units that are sold or intentionally discarded as waste. On-hand stock is never allowed to become negative.\n- Any demand that cannot be met from available local inventory in the period is treated as lost sales and incurs the lost sales penalty. There is no concept of backorders, reservations, or delayed fulfillment.\n- Production for each product in each period cannot exceed the given production capacity. Production is available without delay in this archetype because lead times are effectively zero.\n- Storage capacity at each location and period limits the total volume of on-hand inventory using product-specific storage usage coefficients and location capacities from the JSON. These limits must be respected even in periods where they do not bind.\n- Substitution: Edge [Basic, Premium] means Basic's demand can be served by Premium's inventory when Basic stock is insufficient. S[Basic, Premium] represents units of Basic's demand fulfilled by Premium.\n- There is no transshipment of inventory between locations; each location can only serve its own local demand from its own inventory.\n- Labor capacity is set high enough that it does not bind in this archetype, but if labor constraints are included they must be consistent with the JSON parameters.\n- The objective is to minimize total cost over the horizon, including inventory holding costs, waste costs, and lost sales penalties. No fixed ordering costs, minimum order quantities, lead times, reverse flows, or global budgets are active here.\n\nSTEP 3 - CONSTRAINT TEMPLATES\n\nTask:\nUsing spec_sheet, produce constraint templates as a JSON array.\nYou must DERIVE the mathematical formulas based on the semantic descriptions.\n\nOutput: Single JSON array.

SALES CONSERVATION\n   - Type: BALANCE\n   - Purpose: For each product/location/period, total sales (from all life \n     buckets) plus lost sales must equal the effective demand. Effective \n     demand = original demand + inbound substitution - outbound substitution.\n   - Applies: always\n   - Indices: [p, l, t]\n   - Sense: =\n   - Note: L (lost sales) MUST appear on the left side\n\n3.

AGING\n   - Type: DYNAMICS\n   - Purpose: Inventory in bucket a at period t+1 equals inventory from bucket \n     a+1 at period t minus sales from that bucket. This represents inventory \n     aging by one bucket each period.\n   - Applies: when shelf_life active\n   - Indices: [p, l, t, a] where t < T and a < shelf_life[p]\n   - Sense: =\n   - CRITICAL: Do NOT create for t = T\n\n5. EXPIRE CLEAR\n   - Type: DYNAMICS\n   - Purpose: Waste equals unsold inventory from the expiring bucket (a=1)\n   - Applies: when shelf_life active\n   - Indices: [p, l, t]\n   - Sense: =\n\n6. FRESH INFLOW\n   - Type: DYNAMICS\n   - Purpose: Fresh inventory enters at the highest life bucket. It comes from \n     orders placed lead_time periods ago.\n   - Applies: when shelf_life active\n   - Indices: [p, l, t]\n   - Sense: =\n   - CRITICAL: If t <= lead_time, fresh inflow is 0. Never access negative periods.\n\n7. INITIALIZATION (t=1)\n   - Type: DYNAMICS\n   - Purpose: At the start, all non-fresh inventory buckets are empty\n   - Applies: at t = 1\n   - Indices: [p, l] for each a < shelf_life[p]\n   - Sense: =\n   - CRITICAL: This prevents \"free\" phantom inventory\n\n8. STORAGE CAPACITY\n   - Type: CAPACITY\n   - Purpose: Total weighted inventory at each location cannot exceed storage limit\n   - Applies: when cold_capacity present\n   - Indices: [l, t]\n   - Sense: <=\n\n9. PRODUCTION CAPACITY\n   - Type: CAPACITY\n   - Purpose: Total orders across locations cannot exceed production capacity\n   - Applies: when production_cap present\n   - Indices: [p, t]\n   - Sense: <=\n   - Note: production_cap is 0-indexed list\n\n=============================================================================\nSUBSTITUTION SEMANTICS\n=============================================================================\n\nsub_edges = [[p_from, p_to], ...] means p_from's demand can be served by p_to.\nS[p_from, p_to, l, t] = quantity of p_from's demand served by p_to.\n\nFor each product p, conceptually compute:\n- outbound: sum of S where p is the FROM product (p sends demand out)\n- inbound: sum of S where p is the TO product (p receives and serves demand)\n\n=============================================================================\nYOUR TASK\n=============================================================================\n\nFor each constraint family:\n1. Understand the semantic meaning\n2. Derive the mathematical LHS expression\n3. Derive the mathematical RHS expression\n4. Document boundary conditions in notes\n\n=============================================================================\nDO NOT\n=============================================================================\n\n- Do NOT use variable 'd' - compute demand as demand_curve[p][t-1] * demand_share[l]\n- Do NOT forget L[p,l,t] in sales_conservation\n- Do NOT create aging constraints for t = T\n- Do NOT access orders from period 0 or negative periods\n- Do NOT forget initialization constraints at t = 1",
