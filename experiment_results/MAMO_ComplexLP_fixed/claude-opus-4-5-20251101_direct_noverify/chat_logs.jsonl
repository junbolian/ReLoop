You have identified nine different food items from your local grocery store that you can include in your menu: Chicken, Rice, Apples, Steak, Lentils, Fish, Tofu, Cheese, and Bread. Each of these foods provides varying amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and calories, and each comes with its own price.\n\nHere is the detailed nutritional content and cost for each food item:\n\n- Chicken: Gives you 15 grams of protein, 18 grams of carbohydrates, and 300 calories for $4.\n- Rice: Offers 1 gram of protein, 25 grams of carbohydrates, and 267 calories for $2.\n- Apples: Provide 1 gram of protein, 21 grams of carbohydrates, and 266 calories for $5.\n- Steak: Contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of carbohydrates, and 119 calories for a higher cost of $10.\n- Lentils: These give 3 grams of protein, 7 grams of carbohydrates, and 166 calories for just $2.\n- Fish: Delivers 17 grams of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 129 calories for $8.\n- Tofu: Offers a substantial 18 grams of protein, 27 grams of carbohydrates, and 216 calories for $10.\n- Cheese: Gives 12 grams of protein, 17 grams of carbohydrates, and 76 calories for $9.\n- Bread: Provides 2 grams of protein, a massive 30 grams of carbohydrates, and 258 calories for $4.\n\nYour daily dietary goal is to consume at least 90 grams of protein, 105 grams of carbohydrates, and 1805 calories. Your challenge is to figure out how to meet these nutritional requirements from the food options mentioned above while spending the least amount of money. So, what is the least amount of money you need to spend to meet your daily dietary requirements?

The athlete needs to maintain a high protein, moderate carb diet, with enough calories to sustain their intense training regimen. The goal is to meet these dietary requirements at the lowest cost possible. You have five different food items to choose from: Steak, Rice, Chicken, Iceberg Lettuce, and Almonds. Each of these foods contains varying amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and calories, and each comes with a specific cost.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the nutritional value of each food item and its cost:\n\n- Steak: Offers a whopping 20 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, and 167 calories for $7.\n- Rice: Provides 6 grams of protein, an impressive 29 grams of carbohydrates, and a hefty 275 calories for $8.\n- Chicken: Packs 17 grams of protein, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 112 calories for only $2.\n- Iceberg Lettuce: Contains only 1 gram of protein, 8 grams of carbohydrates, and 148 calories for $8.\n- Almonds: Provide 10 grams of protein, 2 grams of carbohydrates, and a high 286 calories for just $2.\n\nThe athlete's daily dietary requirements are as follows: at least 83 grams of protein, 128 grams of carbohydrates, and 1686 calories.\n\nYour challenge is to select a combination of these foods that meets the athletes' nutritional needs, while keeping the costs as low as possible. So, what is the lowest possible cost to meet these dietary requirements? Note: your response should be a single answer question, asking for the optimal value.\n\n## Data Structure\nThe `data` variable is PRE-DEFINED with these keys:\n- steak_protein_grams: int (scalar)\n- steak_carbohydrates_grams: int (scalar)\n- steak_calories: int (scalar)\n- steak_cost: int (scalar)\n- rice_protein_grams: int (scalar)\n- rice_carbohydrates_grams: int (scalar)\n- rice_calories: int (scalar)\n- rice_cost: int (scalar)\n- chicken_protein_grams: int (scalar)\n- chicken_carbohydrates_grams: int (scalar)\n- chicken_calories: int (scalar)\n- chicken_cost: int (scalar)\n- lettuce_protein_grams: int (scalar)\n- lettuce_carbohydrates_grams: int (scalar)\n- lettuce_calories: int (scalar)\n- lettuce_cost: int (scalar)\n- almonds_protein_grams: int (scalar)\n- almonds_carbohydrates_grams: int (scalar)\n- almonds_calories: int (scalar)\n- almonds_cost: int (scalar)\n- min_protein_requirement: int (scalar)\n- min_carbohydrates_requirement: int (scalar)\n- min_calories_requirement: int (scalar)\n- num_food_items: int (scalar)\n\n---\n## STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM\nFirst, analyze the problem:\n- What is the objective?

(minimize cost / maximize profit / etc.)\n- What decisions need to be made?\n- What constraints exist?\n- What parameters are given?\n\n## STEP 2: FORMULATE THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL\nWrite the formal model:\n- Sets and indices\n- Parameters (use exact keys from data structure)\n- Decision variables with domains\n  **Variable Type**: For each variable, explicitly decide CONTINUOUS, INTEGER, or BINARY.\n  Look for context where fractional values would be physically meaningless\n  (e.g., number of trucks, workers to hire, items to select).\n  State your choice and reasoning.\n- Constraints in mathematical notation\n- Objective function\n\n## STEP 3: GENERATE GUROBI CODE\nWrite Python code using gurobipy.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n1. Do NOT define `data = {...}` - the data variable already exists\n2. Access data as: `data[\"key_name\"]`\n3. Model variable must be named `m`\n4. Set `m.Params.OutputFlag = 0`\n5. Print exactly: `print(f\"status: {m.Status}\")` and `print(f\"objective: {m.ObjVal}\")`\n6. Implement ALL constraints from Step 2\n\n**Big-M Guidelines (if using indicator/logical constraints):**\n- NEVER hardcode Big-M values like `M = 1e6`\n- ALWAYS compute M dynamically from data: `M = sum(data[\"demand\"]) * 1.5`\n- Use problem-relevant parameters for M calculation\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n- Check array length before iteration: `if data[\"items\"]: ...`\n- Avoid division by zero: `max(value, 1e-6)`\n- Use `.get()` for optional keys: `data.get(\"key\", default)`\n\n---\nNow solve the problem.

(minimize cost / maximize profit / etc.)\n- What decisions need to be made?\n- What constraints exist?\n- What parameters are given?\n\n## STEP 2: FORMULATE THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL\nWrite the formal model:\n- Sets and indices\n- Parameters (use exact keys from data structure)\n- Decision variables with domains\n  **Variable Type**: For each variable, explicitly decide CONTINUOUS, INTEGER, or BINARY.\n  Look for context where fractional values would be physically meaningless\n  (e.g., number of trucks, workers to hire, items to select).\n  State your choice and reasoning.\n- Constraints in mathematical notation\n- Objective function\n\n## STEP 3: GENERATE GUROBI CODE\nWrite Python code using gurobipy.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n1. Do NOT define `data = {...}` - the data variable already exists\n2. Access data as: `data[\"key_name\"]`\n3. Model variable must be named `m`\n4. Set `m.Params.OutputFlag = 0`\n5. Print exactly: `print(f\"status: {m.Status}\")` and `print(f\"objective: {m.ObjVal}\")`\n6. Implement ALL constraints from Step 2\n\n**Big-M Guidelines (if using indicator/logical constraints):**\n- NEVER hardcode Big-M values like `M = 1e6`\n- ALWAYS compute M dynamically from data: `M = sum(data[\"demand\"]) * 1.5`\n- Use problem-relevant parameters for M calculation\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n- Check array length before iteration: `if data[\"items\"]: ...`\n- Avoid division by zero: `max(value, 1e-6)`\n- Use `.get()` for optional keys: `data.get(\"key\", default)`\n\n---\nNow solve the problem.

Implement ALL constraints from Step 2\n\n**Big-M Guidelines (if using indicator/logical constraints):**\n- NEVER hardcode Big-M values like `M = 1e6`\n- ALWAYS compute M dynamically from data: `M = sum(data[\"demand\"]) * 1.5`\n- Use problem-relevant parameters for M calculation\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n- Check array length before iteration: `if data[\"items\"]: ...`\n- Avoid division by zero: `max(value, 1e-6)`\n- Use `.get()` for optional keys: `data.get(\"key\", default)`\n\n---\nNow solve the problem.

This network, designed with cutting-edge technology, facilitates the seamless flow of resources - be it energy, data, or materials - from the primary distribution center to the ultimate receiving facility, ensuring the city's heartbeat never skips a beat.\n\nHere's a detailed layout of the transportation capacities between these hubs, measured in units of resources per hour that can be transmitted:\n\n- From Hub 0 (Source): Can dispatch resources to Hub 1 (15 units), Hub 2 (19 units), Hub 3 (4 units), Hub 4 (4 units), Hub 5 (3 units), Hub 6 (20 units), and Hub 7 (17 units).\n- From Hub 1: Can transmit to Hub 0 (8 units), Hub 2 (6 units), Hub 3 (5 units), Hub 4 (20 units), Hub 5 (3 units), Hub 6 (15 units), and Hub 7 (1 unit).\n- From Hub 2: Can route resources to Hub 0 (11 units), Hub 1 (13 units), Hub 3 (16 units), Hub 4 (15 units), Hub 5 (7 units), Hub 6 (10 units), and Hub 7 (13 units).\n- From Hub 3: Can send to Hub 0 (17 units), Hub 1 (20 units), Hub 2 (6 units), Hub 4 (11 units), Hub 5 (3 units), Hub 6 (2 units).\n- From Hub 4: Can distribute to Hub 0 (10 units), Hub 1 (15 units), Hub 2 (5 units), Hub 5 (9 units), Hub 6 (9 units), and Hub 7 (15 units).\n- From Hub 5: Can forward to Hub 0 (9 units), Hub 1 (17 units), Hub 2 (5 units), Hub 3 (1 unit), Hub 4 (9 units), Hub 6 (20 units), and Hub 7 (2 units).\n- From Hub 6: Can transfer to Hub 0 (4 units), Hub 1 (16 units), Hub 2 (10 units), Hub 3 (2 units), Hub 4 (1 unit), Hub 5 (6 units), and Hub 7 (4 units).\n- Lastly, Hub 7 (Destination): Can receive back from Hubs 0 through 6 various capacities, with the specifics already detailed above, marking the end of our resource flow chain.\n\nIn this futuristic city, a \"0\" capacity means there is no established direct transmission link between those particular hubs.\n\nThe critical task at hand is to determine the maximum amount of resources that can be transported from Hub 0 (the source) to Hub 7 (the destination) per hour without overloading any part of this intricate network.

(minimize cost / maximize profit / etc.)\n- What decisions need to be made?\n- What constraints exist?\n- What parameters are given?\n\n## STEP 2: FORMULATE THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL\nWrite the formal model:\n- Sets and indices\n- Parameters (use exact keys from data structure)\n- Decision variables with domains\n  **Variable Type**: For each variable, explicitly decide CONTINUOUS, INTEGER, or BINARY.\n  Look for context where fractional values would be physically meaningless\n  (e.g., number of trucks, workers to hire, items to select).\n  State your choice and reasoning.\n- Constraints in mathematical notation\n- Objective function\n\n## STEP 3: GENERATE GUROBI CODE\nWrite Python code using gurobipy.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n1. Do NOT define `data = {...}` - the data variable already exists\n2. Access data as: `data[\"key_name\"]`\n3. Model variable must be named `m`\n4. Set `m.Params.OutputFlag = 0`\n5. Print exactly: `print(f\"status: {m.Status}\")` and `print(f\"objective: {m.ObjVal}\")`\n6. Implement ALL constraints from Step 2\n\n**Big-M Guidelines (if using indicator/logical constraints):**\n- NEVER hardcode Big-M values like `M = 1e6`\n- ALWAYS compute M dynamically from data: `M = sum(data[\"demand\"]) * 1.5`\n- Use problem-relevant parameters for M calculation\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n- Check array length before iteration: `if data[\"items\"]: ...`\n- Avoid division by zero: `max(value, 1e-6)`\n- Use `.get()` for optional keys: `data.get(\"key\", default)`\n\n---\nNow solve the problem.

The overarching goal is to minimize the total cost involved, which includes the initial opening costs of the distribution centers and the ongoing transportation costs of delivering goods to the retail stores.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Prospective Distribution Centers: 9\n- Number of Retail Stores to be Supplied: 6\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: 151,000\n- Center 2: 192,000\n- Center 3: 114,000\n- Center 4: 171,000\n- Center 5: 160,000\n- Center 6: 120,000\n- Center 7: 182,000\n- Center 8: 186,000\n- Center 9: 174,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1 to Stores: $3 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5, $2 to Store 6\n- From Center 2 to Stores: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6\n- From Center 3 to Stores: $2 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6\n- From Center 4 to Stores: $3 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6\n- From Center 5 to Stores: $4 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $5 to Store 6\n- From Center 6 to Stores: $1 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $2 to Store 6\n- From Center 7 to Stores: $2 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6\n- From Center 8 to Stores: $4 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $1 to Store 6\n- From Center 9 to Stores: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 876 units\n- Store 2: 801 units\n- Store 3: 955 units\n- Store 4: 561 units\n- Store 5: 601 units\n- Store 6: 669 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1615 units\n- Center 2: 1255 units\n- Center 3: 1816 units\n- Center 4: 1095 units\n- Center 5: 1519 units\n- Center 6: 1137 units\n- Center 7: 1678 units\n- Center 8: 1876 units\n- Center 9: 1591 units\n\nQuestion:\nGiven the challenge of selecting the optimal number and combination of distribution centers to open, along with configuring the most cost-effective way to supply the six retail stores to meet their demands, what is the minimal possible total cost for GlobalSupply Inc.? This total cost should include both the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs for delivering goods to the stores.\n\n## Data Structure\nThe `data` variable is PRE-DEFINED with these keys:\n- num_distribution_centers: int (scalar)\n- num_retail_stores: int (scalar)\n- opening_costs: list[9] of int\n- transportation_cost_per_unit: list[9][6] (2D array)\n- store_demand: list[6] of int\n- center_capacity: list[9] of int\n\n---\n## STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM\nFirst, analyze the problem:\n- What is the objective? (minimize cost / maximize profit / etc.)\n- What decisions need to be made?\n- What constraints exist?\n- What parameters are given?\n\n## STEP 2: FORMULATE THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL\nWrite the formal model:\n- Sets and indices\n- Parameters (use exact keys from data structure)\n- Decision variables with domains\n  **Variable Type**: For each variable, explicitly decide CONTINUOUS, INTEGER, or BINARY.\n  Look for context where fractional values would be physically meaningless\n  (e.g., number of trucks, workers to hire, items to select).\n  State your choice and reasoning.\n- Constraints in mathematical notation\n- Objective function\n\n## STEP 3: GENERATE GUROBI CODE\nWrite Python code using gurobipy.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n1. Do NOT define `data = {...}` - the data variable already exists\n2. Access data as: `data[\"key_name\"]`\n3. Model variable must be named `m`\n4. Set `m.Params.OutputFlag = 0`\n5. Print exactly: `print(f\"status: {m.Status}\")` and `print(f\"objective: {m.ObjVal}\")`\n6. Implement ALL constraints from Step 2\n\n**Big-M Guidelines (if using indicator/logical constraints):**\n- NEVER hardcode Big-M values like `M = 1e6`\n- ALWAYS compute M dynamically from data: `M = sum(data[\"demand\"]) * 1.5`\n- Use problem-relevant parameters for M calculation\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n- Check array length before iteration: `if data[\"items\"]: ...`\n- Avoid division by zero: `max(value, 1e-6)`\n- Use `.get()` for optional keys: `data.get(\"key\", default)`\n\n---\nNow solve the problem.

The price of each share of the security is fixed and the payoff of it will be contingent on the outcome of the outcome of the world cup. The information of the 5 securities are shown in Table 1. Here, for example, Security 1\u2019s payoff is 1 if either Argentina, Brazil, or England wins the world cup, and the payoff is 0 if Germany or Spain wins. The Share Limit is the maximum number of shares one can purchase, and Price is the current purchasing price per share of each security. There are five countries, Argentina, Brazil, England, Spain, Germany. Security 1 has a price of 0.75 and a share limit of 10. The payoff for this security is $1 in Argentina, $1 in Brazil, $1 in England, 0 in Germany, and 0 in Spain. Security 2 is priced at 0.35 with a share limit of 5. The payoff is 0 for Argentina, Brazil, or England, but it's $1 for Germany and Spain. Security 3 has a price of 0.40 and a share limit of 10. Similar to Security 2, the payoff is $1 for Argentina, $1 for Spain, and $1 for England, and 0 payoff for Germany and Brazil. Security 4, with a price of 0.75 and a share limit of 10, has payoff of $1 across all countries except for Spain.

The raw material needed to manufacture each type of perfume can be purchased for $3 per pound. Processing 1 lb of raw material requires 1 hour of laboratory time. Each pound of processed raw material yields 3 oz of Regular Brute Perfume and 4 oz of Regular Chanelle Perfume. Regular Brute can be sold for $7/oz and Regular Chanelle for $6/oz. Rylon also has the option of further processing Regular Brute and Regular Chanelle to produce Luxury Brute, sold at $18/oz, and Luxury Chanelle, sold at $14/oz. Each ounce of Regular Brute processed further requires an additional 3 hours of laboratory time and $4 processing cost and yields 1 oz of Luxury Brute. Each ounce of Regular Chanelle processed further requires an additional 2 hours of laboratory time and $4 processing cost and yields 1 oz of Luxury Chanelle. Each year, Rylon has 6,000 hours of laboratory time available and can purchase up to 4,000 lb of raw material. Formulate an LP that can be used to determine how Rylon can maximize profits.
