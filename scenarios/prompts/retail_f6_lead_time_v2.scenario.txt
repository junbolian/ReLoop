[SCENARIO]
Family: F6 (Logistics and Integer Procurement)
Archetype: retail_f6_lead_time
Scenario ID: retail_f6_lead_time_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Orders for each product take several periods to arrive. When the retailer places an order, the goods travel in a pipeline and only become available to serve demand after a deterministic lead time that is specific to each product. Demand is local and exogenous; customers are never backordered, so demand that cannot be met by on-hand inventory in a period is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory system is single-echelon with ordering decisions, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON provides non-zero lead times: SKU_Basic=3, SKU_Premium=4, SKU_ShortLife=2 periods. Orders placed now will only enter on-hand inventory after the corresponding lead time has elapsed.
- Inventory must distinguish between on-hand units and units that are still in transit. Only on-hand units can be used to satisfy demand in a given period; in-transit units become on-hand when their lead time completes.
- For each product and location, on-hand stock in a period is determined by previous on-hand stock plus arrivals of past orders whose lead time has completed, minus sales and waste. Stock levels must remain non-negative.
- Substitution behavior, absence of transshipment, and generous labor capacity remain consistent with other families.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while explicitly capturing the effect of deterministic lead times on inventory decisions.
