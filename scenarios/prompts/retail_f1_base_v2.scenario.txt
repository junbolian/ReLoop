[SCENARIO]
Family: F1 (Core Operations)
Archetype: retail_f1_base
Scenario ID: retail_f1_base_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer manages weekly inventory for several products across multiple distribution centers that directly serve final customer demand. Demand for each product at each location is seasonal and exogenous. Products are replenished each period up to a per-product production or procurement capacity, and any demand that is not served immediately in the period is permanently lost and penalized. Customers are never backlogged or promised future delivery. Inventory is held locally at each distribution center, and there is no movement of stock between locations in this archetype.

Structure cues:
- Time is a discrete sequence of periods defined in the JSON. Decisions about how much to produce or procure and how much to ship to each location are made at the beginning of each period; demand is realized and served within that same period.
- Inventory evolves by carrying over what remains from the previous period, adding any new production assigned to the location, and subtracting units that are sold or intentionally discarded as waste. On-hand stock is never allowed to become negative.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)

- Any demand that cannot be met from available local inventory in the period is treated as lost sales and incurs the lost sales penalty. There is no concept of backorders, reservations, or delayed fulfillment.
- Production for each product in each period cannot exceed the given production capacity. Production is available without delay in this archetype because lead times are effectively zero.
- Storage capacity at each location and period limits the total volume of on-hand inventory using product-specific storage usage coefficients and location capacities from the JSON: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected even in periods where they do not bind.
- Substitution: Edge [p_from, p_to] means p_from's demand can be served by p_to's inventory.
  Variable sub[p_from, p_to, l, t] = units of p_from's demand fulfilled by p_to.

  Demand fulfillment equation:
  - For p_from: total_sales[p_from] + sub[p_from, p_to] + L[p_from] = demand[p_from]
  - For p_to: total_sales[p_to] - sub[p_from, p_to] + L[p_to] = demand[p_to]

  Interpretation: p_from's demand is served by own sales + substitution + lost.
  p_to's total sales include serving both its own demand and p_from's demand.
- There is no transshipment of inventory between locations; each location can only serve its own local demand from its own inventory.
- Labor capacity is set high enough that it does not bind in this archetype, but if labor constraints are included they must be consistent with the JSON parameters.
- The objective is to minimize total cost over the horizon, including inventory holding costs, waste costs, and lost sales penalties. No fixed ordering costs, minimum order quantities, lead times, reverse flows, or global budgets are active here.
