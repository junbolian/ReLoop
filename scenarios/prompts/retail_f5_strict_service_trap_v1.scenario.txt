[SCENARIO]
Family: F5 (Feasibility and Model Repair)
Archetype: retail_f5_strict_service_trap
Scenario ID: retail_f5_strict_service_trap_v1

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Storage capacity is reduced to the point where any attempt to maintain very high service levels conflicts with the physical constraints. The scenario is intended as a trap for models that implicitly assume near-perfect service without allowing lost sales: the only consistent solution is to accept that some demand will not be filled.

Structure cues:
- The inventory structure with production and storage capacity constraints is the same as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Storage capacities are scaled to 10% of normal values, making these constraints very tight.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and is updated from previous stock, production, sales, and waste.
- Unmet demand is treated as lost sales with penalties; backorders are not allowed, and there is no hard requirement that all demand be served.
- There is no transshipment and lead times are zero. Substitution behavior remains as defined.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while recognizing that limited storage capacity makes full service impossible in some periods.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Network data is nested: use data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])
- IMPORTANT: sub_edges and trans_edges are lists of lists [[a,b], ...].
  Convert to tuples for Gurobi indexing: [tuple(e) for e in edges]
- Lists are 0-indexed

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Output ONLY Python code
- Use GurobiPy
- Print status and objective

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
