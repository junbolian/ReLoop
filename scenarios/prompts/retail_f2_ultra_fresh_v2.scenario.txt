[SCENARIO]
Family: F2 (Assortment and Substitution)
Archetype: retail_f2_ultra_fresh
Scenario ID: retail_f2_ultra_fresh_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
This scenario represents extremely short shelf-life products such as daily bakery items or ready-to-eat meals. All products must be sold very soon after arrival; otherwise they must be discarded as waste. Demand for each product at each location is seasonal and exogenous. Customers may switch between products according to the substitution graph, but only non-expired inventory can be used to satisfy demand. There are no backorders and no transshipment.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and assortment framework is the same as in the other Family 2 archetypes: single-echelon, multiple products, local demand, and an encoded substitution graph.
- Shelf-life values in the JSON are very short, measured in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age so that units older than their shelf life are no longer eligible to serve demand.
- When units expire they leave usable inventory and are counted as waste, incurring waste costs. Only non-expired stock can be used to satisfy original and substituted demand.
- Inventory levels must remain non-negative; any demand that cannot be met from non-expired inventory and allowed substitution becomes lost sales.
- Storage capacity, production capacity, the absence of transshipment, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity remain in force.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including short-horizon holding, waste from expiry, and lost sales.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Network data is nested: use data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])
- IMPORTANT: sub_edges and trans_edges are lists of lists [[a,b], ...].
  Convert to tuples for Gurobi indexing: [tuple(e) for e in edges]
- Lists are 0-indexed

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Import: import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB
- Set Gurobi params: m.Params.OutputFlag = 0; m.Params.Threads = 1; m.Params.Seed = 0
- Print at end:
  print(f"status: {{m.Status}}")
  if m.Status == 2:
      print(f"objective: {{m.ObjVal}}")
- Output ONLY executable Python code. No markdown, no explanations.

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
