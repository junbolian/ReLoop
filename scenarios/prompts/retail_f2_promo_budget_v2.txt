You are an optimization modeling assistant specialized in retail supply chains.

Goal: semantic fidelity. The MILP must implement the structurally active mechanisms implied by `data` and the scenario text, not merely compile.

Execution contract:
- The scenario JSON is pre-loaded as a Python dict named `data`. Do NOT modify `data`.
- Do NOT perform any file I/O (no open(), json.load(), Path.read_text(), etc.).
- If the prompt includes a JSON preview, it is for reference only. Do NOT hard-code numeric constants from it.
  Always read sets/parameters from `data` at runtime.

Modeling requirements:
- Implement a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) in Python using gurobipy.
- Include all modules that are structurally active in `data` (and omit inactive ones), such as:
  perishability with remaining-life indexing and aging transitions, shared-capacity coupling,
  directed substitution routing with demand/sales conservation, transshipment flows,
  lead times, discrete procurement (MOQ / pack size / fixed ordering), budgets, and waste caps.

Data semantics (must follow):
- Demand allocation: if `data` contains `demand_curve` by product and period and `demand_share` by location, interpret `demand_curve[p][t]` as total demand for product p in period t, and allocate location demand as `Dem[p,l,t] = demand_curve[p][t] * demand_share[l]`.
- Production/procurement capacity: if `data` contains `production_cap[p][t]` with no location index, interpret it as a global (network-wide) capacity for product p in period t, enforced on orders/production decisions as `sum_l Q[p,l,t] <= production_cap[p][t]`. Lead times (if any) only shift arrivals across periods; do NOT reinterpret `production_cap` as an arrival/inflow cap.

Naming contract (required for automatic semantic checking):
- Use the following variable dictionaries with exactly these names when active:
  I (inventory by remaining life), y (sales/consumption), W (waste),
  Q (orders), L (lost sales), d (direct demand served),
  S (substitution routing), X (transshipment), z (order trigger), n (pack integer).
- When adding constraints, set the `name=` field using these prefixes (plus indices):
  demand_route, sales_conservation, availability, expire_clear, leadtime, returns,
  init, fresh_inflow, aging, storage_cap, prod_cap, labor_cap, moq_lb, moq_ub,
  pack, budget, wastecap.

Objective (reference semantics):
- Minimize total cost including all cost terms present in `data`: holding/inventory, waste, and lost-sales penalties;
  plus purchasing/ordering costs if provided; plus (if enabled) transshipment cost and fixed ordering cost.
- If a cost term is missing in `data`, treat it as zero; do not invent extra data.

Solving and reporting contract (required for comparability):
- Set Gurobi parameters for reproducibility unless explicitly overridden by the evaluation harness:
  OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0.
  Do NOT set TimeLimit unless provided by the harness/environment.
- Always print the solver status code.
- Only treat the printed objective as "final" when status == GRB.OPTIMAL.
- If status is not GRB.OPTIMAL, also print (when available) the best incumbent objective (ObjVal),
  the best bound (ObjBound), and the MIP gap (MIPGap). Do not pretend it is optimal.

Return:
- Output a single Python script as plain text.
- No Markdown, no code fences, and no comments in the returned code.

[SCENARIO]
Family: F2 (Assortment and Substitution)
Archetype: retail_f2_promo_budget
Scenario ID: retail_f2_promo_budget_v2

Business narrative:
In the final periods of the horizon the retailer runs strong promotions on the basic and short-life products, causing their demand to spike. At the same time, an open-to-buy style budget limits how much can be spent in each period on inventory-related activities. The retailer must allocate inventory and spending over time so that promotion-induced demand is supported as well as possible without violating the budget caps.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and substitution structure is the usual single-echelon system with shared storage, production capacity, and a substitution graph, together with lost sales for unmet demand.
- In the last few periods, the JSON scales up demand for the basic and short-life products to represent promotion-induced lifts; these are treated as ordinary exogenous demands with larger magnitudes.
- The JSON also provides a per-period budget for inventory-related spending. For each period, the total purchasing spend (order quantity times purchasing cost) plus any fixed ordering costs if enabled must not exceed this budget.
- Inventory remains non-negative, and any demand that cannot be satisfied within the budget and capacity limits becomes lost sales.
- Storage capacity, substitution behavior, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity remain active as in other Family 2 archetypes.
- The objective is to minimize total cost subject to the per-period budget, making the trade-off between promotion support and resource limits explicit.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
