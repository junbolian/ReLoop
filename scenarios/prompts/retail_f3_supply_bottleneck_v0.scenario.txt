[SCENARIO]
Family: F3 (Shared Resources and Capacity)
Archetype: retail_f3_supply_bottleneck
Scenario ID: retail_f3_supply_bottleneck_v0

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Storage space is abundant but upstream production capacity is tight. The main bottleneck is how many units can be produced or procured each period, not how many can be stored. Demand is still exogenous, local to each location, and there are no backorders or transshipment.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and lost sales logic is the same as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  DECISION VARIABLES - define EXACTLY as specified:
  - Q[p,l,t] = order quantity for product p at location l in period t
    CRITICAL: Q is indexed over (products, locations, periods), NOT just (products, periods)!
    Define as: Q = m.addVars(P, L, T, ...) NOT m.addVars(P, T, ...)
  - I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining
  - sales[p,l,t,r] = units sold from inventory cohort with r remaining life
  - W[p,l,t] = waste (expired units)
  - L[p,l,t] = lost sales (unmet demand)

  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,l,t]
      - Each location places its OWN orders. Q[p,l,t] is already per-location.
      - Do NOT multiply by demand_share. demand_share is ONLY for calculating demand values.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Storage capacities in the JSON are set very high so that storage constraints are effectively non-binding.
- Per-product production capacities are significantly reduced. These caps must be enforced and become the main source of unmet demand.
- Inventory at each location and period stays non-negative and changes according to local production, sales, and waste.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior is determined by the substitution graph with standard semantics.
- The objective is to minimize total cost, with lost sales penalties playing a central role because of tight production capacity.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Lists are 0-indexed (period t in model uses index [t-1] in data arrays)

CRITICAL - Network edges require tuple conversion for Gurobi:
  sub_edges = [tuple(e) for e in data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])]
  trans_edges = [tuple(e) for e in data.get('network', {}).get('trans_edges', [])]

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Import: import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB
- Set Gurobi params: m.Params.OutputFlag = 0; m.Params.Threads = 1; m.Params.Seed = 0
- Print at end:
  print(f"status: {{m.Status}}")
  if m.Status == 2:
      print(f"objective: {{m.ObjVal}}")
- Output ONLY executable Python code. No markdown, no explanations.

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
