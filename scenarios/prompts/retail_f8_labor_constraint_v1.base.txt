Scenario ID: retail_f8_labor_constraint_v1

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Store and warehouse labor capacity directly limits how much inventory can be handled in each period. Labor is required for activities such as receiving, picking, and replenishment, and total labor usage per period at a location cannot exceed a location-specific cap. Demand is local and exogenous; unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory system is single-echelon with production, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- Labor capacity: The JSON provides labor_cap=200 per location per period, and labor_usage per product (SKU_Basic=0.1, SKU_Premium=0.2, SKU_ShortLife=0.1). Total labor consumed at a location in a period must not exceed this capacity: sum over products of (labor_usage[p] * units_handled[p,l,t]) <= labor_cap[l,t].
- A simple representation is to treat labor usage as proportional to the volume of units handled, such as the sum of units received, picked, or moved for that product and period.
- Inventory balance follows the usual pattern: previous stock plus arrivals minus sales and waste, with non-negative inventory and lost sales for unmet demand.
- There is no transshipment in this archetype.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting labor capacity constraints, which may bind in busy periods.
