[SCENARIO]
Family: F8 (Omni channel and Store Operations)
Archetype: retail_f8_labor_constraint
Scenario ID: retail_f8_labor_constraint_v1

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Store and warehouse labor capacity directly limits how much inventory can be handled in each period. Labor is required for activities such as receiving, picking, and replenishment, and total labor usage per period at a location cannot exceed a location-specific cap. Demand is local and exogenous; unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory system is single-echelon with production, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  DECISION VARIABLES - define EXACTLY as specified:
  - Q[p,l,t] = order quantity for product p at location l in period t
    CRITICAL: Q is indexed over (products, locations, periods), NOT just (products, periods)!
    Define as: Q = m.addVars(P, L, T, ...) NOT m.addVars(P, T, ...)
  - I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining
  - sales[p,l,t,r] = units sold from inventory cohort with r remaining life
  - W[p,l,t] = waste (expired units)
  - L[p,l,t] = lost sales (unmet demand)

  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,l,t]
      - Each location places its OWN orders. Q[p,l,t] is already per-location.
      - Do NOT multiply by demand_share. demand_share is ONLY for calculating demand values.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- Labor capacity: The JSON provides labor_cap=200 per location per period, and labor_usage per product (SKU_Basic=0.1, SKU_Premium=0.2, SKU_ShortLife=0.1). Total labor consumed at a location in a period must not exceed this capacity: sum over products of (labor_usage[p] * units_handled[p,l,t]) <= labor_cap[l,t].
- A simple representation is to treat labor usage as proportional to the volume of units handled, such as the sum of units received, picked, or moved for that product and period.
- Inventory balance follows the usual pattern: previous stock plus arrivals minus sales and waste, with non-negative inventory and lost sales for unmet demand.
- There is no transshipment in this archetype.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting labor capacity constraints, which may bind in busy periods.
