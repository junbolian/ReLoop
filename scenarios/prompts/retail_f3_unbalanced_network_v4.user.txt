[SCENARIO]
Family: F3 (Shared Resources and Capacity)
Archetype: retail_f3_unbalanced_network
Scenario ID: retail_f3_unbalanced_network_v4

Business narrative:
Storage capacity is highly unbalanced across locations. One location acts as a high-capacity hub with ample space, while all other locations have very limited storage. Demand is still local to each location, and there is no movement of inventory between locations. The retailer must decide how much to store at each site given these asymmetric capacity limits.

Structure cues:
- The inventory system remains single-echelon with local demand at each location and no transshipment.
- The JSON concentrates storage capacity at one hub location and gives very small capacities to the satellites. The model must enforce per-location storage constraints using these capacities and product storage usage coefficients.
- Inventory for each product and location evolves from previous stock and local production, minus sales and waste, without ever going below zero.
- Production capacities, zero lead times, and substitution behavior are as in the base scenario.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting the highly asymmetric storage limits across locations.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
