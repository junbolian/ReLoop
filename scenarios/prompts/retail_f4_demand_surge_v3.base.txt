Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_demand_surge
Scenario ID: retail_f4_demand_surge_v3

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer experiences a single-period viral demand spike where demand suddenly multiplies for all products. Production capacity and other structural elements remain unchanged; only the magnitude of demand in that period is much higher. The retailer must decide whether to build extra inventory in advance or accept lost sales during the surge.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and production structure is the same as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- In the JSON, one mid-horizon period has demand for each product scaled up by a large factor, representing the surge. This period is treated as having much higher exogenous demand.
- Inventory stays non-negative and is updated using previous stock, current production, sales, and waste.
- Substitution behavior is unchanged, there is no transshipment, and lead times remain effectively zero.
- The objective is to minimize total cost, with the demand spike increasing the importance of planning ahead for that particular period.
