[SCENARIO]
Family: F8 (Omni channel and Store Operations)
Archetype: retail_f8_ship_from_store
Scenario ID: retail_f8_ship_from_store_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Stores fulfill both walk-in traffic and online orders, effectively acting as small fulfillment centers that ship from store. Storage capacity and labor capacity at stores are scaled up, but labor usage per unit is higher when stores serve both channels. Demand from walk-in and online customers is aggregated into a single local demand stream per product and location, and unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory structure is single-echelon with local demand at each location, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Storage capacities are scaled to 5x normal values to accommodate dual-channel operations.
- Labor capacity: The JSON provides labor_cap=500 per location per period, with higher labor_usage per product (SKU_Basic=0.5, SKU_Premium=0.8, SKU_ShortLife=0.6) reflecting the additional work from online fulfillment.
- Stores conceptually serve two demand streams, but the model treats them as a single aggregated demand per product and location.
- Inventory remains non-negative and is updated from previous stock and production, minus sales and waste.
- There is no transshipment; lead times are zero, and substitution behavior remains as encoded.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while balancing higher labor intensity against increased capacity.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Network data is nested: use data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])
- IMPORTANT: sub_edges and trans_edges are lists of lists [[a,b], ...].
  Convert to tuples for Gurobi indexing: [tuple(e) for e in edges]
- Lists are 0-indexed

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Output ONLY Python code
- Use GurobiPy
- Print status and objective

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
