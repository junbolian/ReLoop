[SCENARIO]
Family: F2 (Assortment and Substitution)
Archetype: retail_f2_promo_budget
Scenario ID: retail_f2_promo_budget_v3

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
In the final periods of the horizon the retailer runs strong promotions on the basic and short-life products, causing their demand to spike. At the same time, an open-to-buy style budget limits how much can be spent in each period on inventory-related activities. The retailer must allocate inventory and spending over time so that promotion-induced demand is supported as well as possible without violating the budget caps.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and substitution structure is the usual single-echelon system with shared storage, production capacity, and a substitution graph, together with lost sales for unmet demand.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE. Use I[p,l,t,r] where r = remaining periods until expiry (1..shelf_life[p]). Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first under FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST. Key equations: (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l] where Q is total production. (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1. (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]. (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r].
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- In the last few periods, the JSON scales up demand for the basic and short-life products to represent promotion-induced lifts; these are treated as ordinary exogenous demands with larger magnitudes.
- The JSON also provides a per-period budget for inventory-related spending. For each period, the total purchasing spend (order quantity times purchasing cost) plus any fixed ordering costs if enabled must not exceed this budget.
- Inventory remains non-negative, and any demand that cannot be satisfied within the budget and capacity limits becomes lost sales.
- Substitution behavior, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity remain active as in other Family 2 archetypes.
- The objective is to minimize total cost subject to the per-period budget, making the trade-off between promotion support and resource limits explicit.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Lists are 0-indexed (period t in model uses index [t-1] in data arrays)

CRITICAL - Network edges require tuple conversion for Gurobi:
  sub_edges = [tuple(e) for e in data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])]
  trans_edges = [tuple(e) for e in data.get('network', {}).get('trans_edges', [])]

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Import: import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB
- Set Gurobi params: m.Params.OutputFlag = 0; m.Params.Threads = 1; m.Params.Seed = 0
- Print at end:
  print(f"status: {{m.Status}}")
  if m.Status == 2:
      print(f"objective: {{m.ObjVal}}")
- Output ONLY executable Python code. No markdown, no explanations.

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
