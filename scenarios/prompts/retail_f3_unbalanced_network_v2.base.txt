Scenario ID: retail_f3_unbalanced_network_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Storage capacity is highly unbalanced across locations. One location acts as a high-capacity hub with ample space, while all other locations have very limited storage. Demand is still local to each location, and there is no movement of inventory between locations. The retailer must decide how much to store at each site given these asymmetric capacity limits.

Structure cues:
- The inventory system remains single-echelon with local demand at each location and no transshipment.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,l,t]
      - Q[p,l,t] is the order quantity for product p at location l in period t.
      - Orders are placed PER LOCATION, not centralized. Do NOT use Q[p,t] * demand_share[l].

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. The JSON concentrates storage capacity at one hub location and gives very small capacities to the satellites.
- Inventory for each product and location evolves from previous stock and local production, minus sales and waste, without ever going below zero.
- Production capacities, zero lead times, and substitution behavior are as in the base scenario.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting the highly asymmetric storage limits across locations.
