[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer faces a minimum order quantity applied uniformly across the category. In any period, the buyer must either place no order for a product or place an order that is at least as large as the specified global minimum. It is never allowed to place a small positive order below that threshold. This creates an all-or-nothing structure in procurement decisions on top of the usual inventory and storage logic.

Structure cues:
- The system is single-echelon with ordering decisions, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON specifies moq=300 in the "constraints" object. For each product, location, and period, the order quantity must either be zero or at least 300; intermediate positive quantities below moq are forbidden.
- This all-or-nothing pattern must be enforced consistently across products, locations, and periods so that the model does not exploit fractional orders below the global minimum.
- Inventory balance follows the standard pattern with zero lead time: on-hand stock in a period comes from previous stock and current orders, minus sales and waste, and cannot become negative.
- There is no transshipment; substitution behavior follows the JSON graph, and labor capacity is generous.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding, waste, lost sales, and the implicit cost of being forced to buy in minimum lots.
