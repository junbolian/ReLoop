[SCENARIO]
Family: F7 (Network and Multi Echelon)
Archetype: retail_f7_multi_sourcing
Scenario ID: retail_f7_multi_sourcing_v4

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Products differ in their effective sourcing regimes: some behave like slow but cheap supply, while others behave like fast but expensive supply. Lead times and holding costs vary across products, creating multi-speed inventory dynamics. Demand is local and exogenous at each location, and unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory structure is single-echelon with product-specific lead times, similar to retail_f6_lead_time, together with storage capacity and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON sets different lead times (SKU_Basic=5, SKU_Premium=0, SKU_ShortLife=1) and holding costs (SKU_Basic=0.5, SKU_Premium=10.0). Orders for each product become available only after that product's lead time, and inventory carried over incurs its corresponding holding cost.
- For each product, location, and period, on-hand stock is determined by previous on-hand stock, arrivals of past orders whose lead time completes in that period, sales, and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- The scenario mimics slow/cheap (Basic) and fast/expensive (Premium) sourcing channels at the product level through heterogeneous lead times and cost profiles.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while correctly handling the different lead times and holding-cost profiles.
