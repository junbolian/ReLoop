[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
A fraction of units sold in each period are returned by customers in the next period and re-enter inventory as reverse flow. Returns are product-specific and location-specific, and can be used to satisfy future demand as long as they have not expired or violated storage limits. Demand is local and exogenous; unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The system is single-echelon with production, storage, and lost sales, extended to include reverse flows from returns.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  DECISION VARIABLES - define EXACTLY as specified:
  - Q[p,l,t] = order quantity for product p at location l in period t
    CRITICAL: Q is indexed over (products, locations, periods), NOT just (products, periods)!
    Define as: Q = m.addVars(P, L, T, ...) NOT m.addVars(P, T, ...)
  - I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining
  - sales[p,l,t,r] = units sold from inventory cohort with r remaining life
  - W[p,l,t] = waste (expired units)
  - L[p,l,t] = lost sales (unmet demand)

  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,l,t]
      - Each location places its OWN orders. Q[p,l,t] is already per-location.
      - Do NOT multiply by demand_share. demand_share is ONLY for calculating demand values.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1) Returned units re-enter as age-1 inventory.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits apply to all inventory including returns.
- The JSON specifies return rates: SKU_Basic=20%, SKU_Premium=10%, SKU_ShortLife=5%. For each product and location, this fraction of units sold in one period re-enters as usable inventory at the same location in the next period.
- Inventory at each period includes previous stock, current production, and returns from prior sales, minus current-period sales and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- There is no transshipment in this archetype, and lead times for production are zero.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding, waste, lost sales, and any indirect effect of handling returns as captured in the cost parameters.
