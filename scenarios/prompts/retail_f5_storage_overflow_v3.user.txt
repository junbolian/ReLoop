[SCENARIO]
Family: F5 (Feasibility and Model Repair)
Archetype: retail_f5_storage_overflow
Scenario ID: retail_f5_storage_overflow_v3

Business narrative:
Storage capacities are set extremely close to zero so that almost any inbound inventory risks violating capacity if not very tightly controlled. The scenario stresses whether the model correctly enforces capacity and uses waste and lost sales to maintain feasibility rather than silently overfilling locations.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and production framework is the same single-echelon system with storage constraints.
- In the JSON, storage capacities are near zero at all locations. The volume-weighted sum of on-hand inventory must remain within these tiny capacities at every period.
- Inventory must stay non-negative and is adjusted through production, sales, and waste. In most periods, on-hand inventory must be kept very low to satisfy capacity.
- Unmet demand becomes lost sales, and discarding inventory becomes an important decision despite its cost.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior is unchanged.
- The objective is to minimize total cost, trading off waste and lost sales under extremely strict storage capacity.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
