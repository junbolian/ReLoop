[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Stores fulfill both walk-in traffic and online orders, effectively acting as small fulfillment centers that ship from store. Storage capacity and labor capacity at stores are scaled up, but labor usage per unit is higher when stores serve both channels. Demand from walk-in and online customers is aggregated into a single local demand stream per product and location, and unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory structure is single-echelon with local demand at each location, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE. Use I[p,l,t,r] where r = remaining periods until expiry (1..shelf_life[p]). Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first under FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST. Key equations: (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l] where Q is total production. (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1. (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]. (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r].
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Storage capacities are scaled to 5x normal values to accommodate dual-channel operations.
- Labor capacity: The JSON provides labor_cap=500 per location per period, with higher labor_usage per product (SKU_Basic=0.5, SKU_Premium=0.8, SKU_ShortLife=0.6) reflecting the additional work from online fulfillment.
- Stores conceptually serve two demand streams, but the model treats them as a single aggregated demand per product and location.
- Inventory remains non-negative and is updated from previous stock and production, minus sales and waste.
- There is no transshipment; lead times are zero, and substitution behavior remains as encoded.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while balancing higher labor intensity against increased capacity.
