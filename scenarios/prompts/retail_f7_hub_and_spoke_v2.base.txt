[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The network has one high-capacity hub distribution center that ships to several low-capacity spokes. All lateral movements must pass through the hub; spokes cannot ship directly to each other or back to the hub. Demand occurs at spokes and is local. This captures a hub-and-spoke distribution strategy where stock is pooled at the hub and then pushed out to stores.

Structure cues:
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. DC1 (hub) has capacity 50000, while other locations (spokes) have capacity 500 each.
- The transshipment network consists only of directed edges from DC1 (hub) to each spoke [DC2, DC3, DC4, DC5]. Inventory can move from the hub to the spokes but not directly between spokes and not from spokes back to the hub.
- For each product, location, and period, inventory evolves based on local production (if any), inbound shipments, outbound shipments, sales (at spokes), and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- Transshipment flows from the hub are limited by the hub's available inventory and incur transshipment costs. Spokes largely rely on inbound shipments from the hub to meet local demand.
- Lead times for transshipment are effectively zero, and substitution behavior remains as encoded.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while exploiting the centralized hub structure.
