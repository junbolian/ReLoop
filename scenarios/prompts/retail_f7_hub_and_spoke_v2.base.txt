[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The network has one high-capacity hub distribution center that ships to several low-capacity spokes. All lateral movements must pass through the hub; spokes cannot ship directly to each other or back to the hub. Demand occurs at spokes and is local. This captures a hub-and-spoke distribution strategy where stock is pooled at the hub and then pushed out to stores.

Structure cues:
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE. Use I[p,l,t,r] where r = remaining periods until expiry (1..shelf_life[p]). Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first under FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST. Key equations: (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l] where Q is total production. (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1. (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]. (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r].
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. DC1 (hub) has capacity 50000, while other locations (spokes) have capacity 500 each.
- The transshipment network consists only of directed edges from DC1 (hub) to each spoke [DC2, DC3, DC4, DC5]. Inventory can move from the hub to the spokes but not directly between spokes and not from spokes back to the hub.
- For each product, location, and period, inventory evolves based on local production (if any), inbound shipments, outbound shipments, sales (at spokes), and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- Transshipment flows from the hub are limited by the hub's available inventory and incur transshipment costs. Spokes largely rely on inbound shipments from the hub to meet local demand.
- Lead times for transshipment are effectively zero, and substitution behavior remains as encoded.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while exploiting the centralized hub structure.
