[SCENARIO]
Family: F2 (Assortment and Substitution)
Archetype: retail_f2_no_substitution
Scenario ID: retail_f2_no_substitution_v1

Business narrative:
The retailer manages multiple products that do not substitute for each other. Customers either buy the specific product they requested or, if it is unavailable, do not purchase anything and generate a lost sale. Demand for each product at each location is exogenous and seasonal. Inventory is held locally with no transshipment and no backorders, and there is no cross-product switching under any circumstances.

Structure cues:
- The physical setup matches retail_f1_base: single-echelon, multi-product, multi-location, with inventory held only at the locations that serve final demand.
- Inventory at each location and period starts from the previous period's ending stock, is increased by local production or procurement, and is decreased by sales and waste. Stock cannot become negative.
- Storage capacity constraints limit the volume-weighted on-hand inventory at each location and period using the storage usage parameters and capacities from the JSON.
- In this archetype, the substitution graph in the JSON is empty (sub_edges = []). The model must not allow demand for one product to be satisfied by any other product; each product's demand can only be met by its own on-hand inventory at that location.
- There is no transshipment of inventory between locations, lead times are effectively zero, and labor capacity is large relative to demand.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding, waste, and lost sales without any cross-product substitution logic.

MODELING GUIDELINES
=============================================================================
[CORE RULES]
- `data` is a pre-loaded Python dict. Do not modify it.
- No file I/O. Never invent missing data.
- Never hard-code numeric values.
- Output must be plain Python code. No prose, no markdown, no comments.

[DATA FORMAT]
- sub_edges: [[p_from, p_to], ...] means p_from's demand can be served by p_to's inventory.
- trans_edges: [[loc_from, loc_to], ...] for transshipment.
- demand_share: {location: scalar}, NOT nested by product.
- demand = demand_curve[p][t-1] * demand_share[l]  (demand_curve is 0-indexed)
- Time indexing: 1-based (t = 1, 2, ..., T).

[SUBSTITUTION SEMANTICS - CRITICAL]
Edge [p_from, p_to] = "upward substitution": p_to can serve p_from's demand.
S[p_from, p_to, l, t] = quantity of p_from's demand served by p_to.

Build edge mappings BEFORE constraints:
  outgoing_edges = {p: [] for p in products}
  incoming_edges = {p: [] for p in products}
  for p_from, p_to in sub_edges:
      outgoing_edges[p_from].append(p_to)  # p_from sends demand OUT to p_to
      incoming_edges[p_to].append(p_from)  # p_to receives requests IN from p_from

Compute substitution flows for each product p:
  outbound = sum S[p, pt, l, t] for pt in outgoing_edges[p]  # demand p sends out
  inbound  = sum S[pf, p, l, t] for pf in incoming_edges[p]  # requests p receives

Substitution constraints:
  demand_route: outbound <= demand[p,l,t]  (can't substitute more than own demand)
  sales_conservation: sum_a(y[p,l,t,a]) + L[p,l,t] = demand[p,l,t] + inbound - outbound

[SHELF-LIFE / AGING]
- Life buckets: a = 1 (expiring) to a = shelf_life[p] (freshest)
- Aging: I[p,l,t+1,a] = I[p,l,t,a+1] - y[p,l,t,a+1]  (for a < shelf_life, t < T)
- Expiration: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - y[p,l,t,1]
- Availability: y[p,l,t,a] <= I[p,l,t,a]
- Holding cost: apply only to a >= 2 (not expiring bucket a=1)

[FRESH INFLOW - BOUNDARY CONDITIONS]
Fresh inventory enters at a = shelf_life[p]:
  if t > lead_time[p]:
      I[p,l,t,shelf_life] = Q[p,l,t-lead_time]
  else:
      I[p,l,t,shelf_life] = 0
NEVER access Q[p,l,0] or negative indices - they don't exist.

[INITIALIZATION at t=1]
  I[p,l,1,a] = 0  for a < shelf_life[p]  (non-fresh buckets empty)
  I[p,l,1,shelf_life] = Q[p,l,1] if lead_time=0, else 0

[AGING BOUNDARY at t=T]
Do NOT add aging constraints for t=T, as they would reference I[p,l,T+1,a] which doesn't exist.

[VARIABLE NAMING]
Use these exact names:
- I[p,l,t,a]: inventory by product, location, period, remaining life bucket
- y[p,l,t,a]: sales/consumption from life bucket
- W[p,l,t]: waste (expired inventory)
- Q[p,l,t]: orders/production
- L[p,l,t]: lost sales
- S[p_from,p_to,l,t]: substitution flow (only if sub_edges nonempty)

[SOLVING]
- Gurobi params: OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0.
- Print: print(f"status: {m.Status}")
- If OPTIMAL: print(f"objective: {m.ObjVal}")

=============================================================================
DATA ACCESS
=============================================================================

The evaluation harness loads the JSON into a Python variable called `data`.
Read all parameters from `data`. Do not use file I/O.

Key fields:
- data["periods"]: int (number of time periods)
- data["products"]: list of product IDs
- data["locations"]: list of location IDs
- data["shelf_life"][p]: int, life buckets per product
- data["lead_time"][p]: int, delivery delay (may be 0)
- data["demand_curve"][p]: list (0-indexed, use [t-1] for period t)
- data["demand_share"][l]: scalar share per location
- data["network"]["sub_edges"]: [[p_from, p_to], ...]
- data["network"]["trans_edges"]: [[l_from, l_to], ...]
- data["costs"]["inventory"][p], ["waste"][p], ["lost_sales"][p], ["purchasing"][p]
- data["production_cap"][p]: list or scalar (per period)
- data["cold_capacity"][l], data["cold_usage"][p]



[INSTRUCTION]
Write a complete GurobiPy script that:
1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB)
2) Reads all parameters from `data` (already loaded)
3) Builds edge mappings for substitution BEFORE creating constraints
4) Creates all decision variables with correct indices
5) Sets objective: minimize inventory + waste + lost_sales + purchasing costs
6) Adds all constraints respecting boundary conditions:
   - Initialization at t=1
   - Aging only for t < T
   - Fresh inflow with lead_time check
   - Substitution if sub_edges nonempty
7) Sets Gurobi params: OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0
8) Prints status always; prints objective only if OPTIMAL

Return ONLY Python code. No markdown, no comments, no explanations.
