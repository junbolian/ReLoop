[SCENARIO]
Family: F7 (Network and Multi Echelon)
Archetype: retail_f7_multi_sourcing
Scenario ID: retail_f7_multi_sourcing_v3

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Products differ in their effective sourcing regimes: some behave like slow but cheap supply, while others behave like fast but expensive supply. Lead times and holding costs vary across products, creating multi-speed inventory dynamics. Demand is local and exogenous at each location, and unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory structure is single-echelon with product-specific lead times, similar to retail_f6_lead_time, together with storage capacity and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON sets different lead times (SKU_Basic=5, SKU_Premium=0, SKU_ShortLife=1) and holding costs (SKU_Basic=0.5, SKU_Premium=10.0). Orders for each product become available only after that product's lead time, and inventory carried over incurs its corresponding holding cost.
- For each product, location, and period, on-hand stock is determined by previous on-hand stock, arrivals of past orders whose lead time completes in that period, sales, and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- The scenario mimics slow/cheap (Basic) and fast/expensive (Premium) sourcing channels at the product level through heterogeneous lead times and cost profiles.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while correctly handling the different lead times and holding-cost profiles.
