[SCENARIO]
Family: F7 (Network and Multi Echelon)
Archetype: retail_f7_hub_and_spoke
Scenario ID: retail_f7_hub_and_spoke_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The network has one high-capacity hub distribution center that ships to several low-capacity spokes. All lateral movements must pass through the hub; spokes cannot ship directly to each other or back to the hub. Demand occurs at spokes and is local. This captures a hub-and-spoke distribution strategy where stock is pooled at the hub and then pushed out to stores.

Structure cues:
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. DC1 (hub) has capacity 50000, while other locations (spokes) have capacity 500 each.
- The transshipment network consists only of directed edges from DC1 (hub) to each spoke [DC2, DC3, DC4, DC5]. Inventory can move from the hub to the spokes but not directly between spokes and not from spokes back to the hub.
- For each product, location, and period, inventory evolves based on local production (if any), inbound shipments, outbound shipments, sales (at spokes), and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- Transshipment flows from the hub are limited by the hub's available inventory and incur transshipment costs. Spokes largely rely on inbound shipments from the hub to meet local demand.
- Lead times for transshipment are effectively zero, and substitution behavior remains as encoded.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while exploiting the centralized hub structure.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Network data is nested: use data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])
- IMPORTANT: sub_edges and trans_edges are lists of lists [[a,b], ...].
  Convert to tuples for Gurobi indexing: [tuple(e) for e in edges]
- Lists are 0-indexed

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Import: import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB
- Set Gurobi params: m.Params.OutputFlag = 0; m.Params.Threads = 1; m.Params.Seed = 0
- Print at end:
  print(f"status: {{m.Status}}")
  if m.Status == 2:
      print(f"objective: {{m.ObjVal}}")
- Output ONLY executable Python code. No markdown, no explanations.

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
