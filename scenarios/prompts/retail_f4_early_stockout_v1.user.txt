[SCENARIO]
Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_early_stockout
Scenario ID: retail_f4_early_stockout_v1

Business narrative:
The retailer experiences an upstream supply failure at launch. For several initial periods, no production is possible for any product, but customer demand already exists at the locations. The retailer must decide how much inventory to build before the disruption and how to ration demand while supply is temporarily unavailable. Unserved demand in the disruption window is lost and penalized; customers are not backordered.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, storage, and lost sales framework matches the base scenario: single-echelon, local inventories, and no transshipment.
- In the JSON, production capacity for all products is set to zero in early periods. The model must respect this by not assigning any new production in those periods.
- Inventory remains non-negative and changes from period to period based on previous stock, any allowed production (zero during the disruption), sales, and waste.
- Storage capacity, substitution behavior, and zero lead times remain unchanged from the baseline.
- Labor capacity is generous and does not bind.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while capturing the trade-off between carrying inventory into the supply failure (and paying holding or waste costs) and accepting lost sales during the disruption.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
