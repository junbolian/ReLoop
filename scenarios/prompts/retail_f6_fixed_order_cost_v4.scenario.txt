Family: F6 (Logistics and Integer Procurement)
Archetype: retail_f6_fixed_order_cost
Scenario ID: retail_f6_fixed_order_cost_v4

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Placing an order in a period incurs a fixed cost regardless of how large the order is. This encourages batching orders into fewer, larger replenishments instead of many small ones. The retailer still faces local demand, storage limits, and lost sales for unmet demand, but now each decision to place any positive order carries an additional setup-like cost.

Structure cues:
- The structure is single-echelon with ordering decisions, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  DECISION VARIABLES - define EXACTLY as specified:
  - Q[p,l,t] = order quantity for product p at location l in period t
    CRITICAL: Q is indexed over (products, locations, periods), NOT just (products, periods)!
    Define as: Q = m.addVars(P, L, T, ...) NOT m.addVars(P, T, ...)
  - I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining
  - sales[p,l,t,r] = units sold from inventory cohort with r remaining life
  - W[p,l,t] = waste (expired units)
  - L[p,l,t] = lost sales (unmet demand)

  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,l,t]
      - Each location places its OWN orders. Q[p,l,t] is already per-location.
      - Do NOT multiply by demand_share. demand_share is ONLY for calculating demand values.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON includes fixed_order=5000 in the "costs" object. Whenever a strictly positive order is placed for a product at a location in a period, this fixed cost must be charged once for that product-location-period in addition to variable purchasing costs.
- The model must ensure that the fixed cost is applied if and only if the total order quantity for a product at a location in a period is positive; it should not be possible to evade the fixed cost with arbitrarily small orders.
- Inventory balance under zero lead time is standard: on-hand stock is updated from previous stock and current orders, minus sales and waste, and cannot drop below zero.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior is unchanged.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including fixed ordering costs, holding, waste, and lost sales.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Lists are 0-indexed (period t in model uses index [t-1] in data arrays)

CRITICAL - Network edges require tuple conversion for Gurobi:
  sub_edges = [tuple(e) for e in data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])]
  trans_edges = [tuple(e) for e in data.get('network', {}).get('trans_edges', [])]

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Import: import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB
- Set Gurobi params: m.Params.OutputFlag = 0; m.Params.Threads = 1; m.Params.Seed = 0
- Print at end:
  print(f"status: {{m.Status}}")
  if m.Status == 2:
      print(f"objective: {{m.ObjVal}}")
- Output ONLY executable Python code. No markdown, no explanations.

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
