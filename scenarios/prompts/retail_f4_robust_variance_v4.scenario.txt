[SCENARIO]
Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_robust_variance
Scenario ID: retail_f4_robust_variance_v4

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Demand alternates between high and low phases over the planning horizon, and lost sales are made very expensive. This mimics a robust-planning environment where the retailer must guard against demand variance rather than a single deterministic forecast. Demand is still exogenous and local at each location, with no backorders and no transshipment.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, storage, and production structure is the same single-echelon system as in the base scenario, with per-product production capacities and local inventories at each location.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- In the JSON, demand curves oscillate across periods, creating repeated high-demand and low-demand phases; lost sales penalties are increased for all products so that stockouts are very costly.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and evolves from previous stock and current production, minus sales and waste.
- Substitution behavior, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity remain in effect as in other Family 4 archetypes.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding, waste, and large lost sales penalties, encouraging robust safety-stock style planning against the demand variance.
