[SCENARIO]
Family: F8 (Omni channel and Store Operations)
Archetype: retail_f8_sustainability
Scenario ID: retail_f8_sustainability_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer operates under a sustainability or regulatory constraint that limits total waste. Over the entire planning horizon, the total quantity discarded as waste must not exceed a fixed fraction of total demand. Demand is local and exogenous; unmet demand is lost and penalized. The retailer must balance serving demand, avoiding stockouts, and limiting waste.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and production structure is the same single-echelon system with storage capacity and lost sales as in the base scenario.
- The JSON specifies a waste limit percentage. Over the horizon, the total waste across all products, locations, and periods must not exceed the given fraction of total demand.
- Inventory is updated from previous stock and production, minus sales and waste, and remains non-negative.
- Storage capacity constraints and substitution behavior remain active as defined in the JSON, and there is no transshipment.
- The objective is to minimize total cost subject to the global waste cap, making trade-offs between holding more inventory, losing sales, and discarding units explicit.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Network data is nested: use data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])
- Lists are 0-indexed

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Output ONLY Python code
- Use GurobiPy
- Print status and objective

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
