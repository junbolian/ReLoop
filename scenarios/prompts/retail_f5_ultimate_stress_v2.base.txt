[SCENARIO]
Family: F5 (Feasibility and Model Repair)
Archetype: retail_f5_ultimate_stress
Scenario ID: retail_f5_ultimate_stress_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
This is a composite stress test that combines three stressors: tight storage capacity, a mid-horizon production failure during a peak period, and the absence of any substitution between products. Demand is local and exogenous at each location. The scenario is designed as a boss-level test where the only viable strategy is to accept significant lost sales while respecting all physical constraints.

Structure cues:
- The archetype combines the storage bottleneck of retail_f3_storage_bottleneck (30% capacity), the peak supply failure of retail_f4_peak_failure (production=0 for periods 8-11), and the no-substitution structure of retail_f2_no_substitution (sub_edges=[]).
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE. Use I[p,l,t,r] where r = remaining periods until expiry (1..shelf_life[p]). Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first under FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST. Key equations: (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l] where Q is total production. (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1. (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]. (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r].
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Storage capacities are scaled to 30% of normal values and must be enforced as binding constraints.
- Production capacities are set to zero during a mid-horizon peak window (periods 8-11), so no new units can be produced in those periods.
- The substitution graph is empty (sub_edges = []), so each product's demand can only be served by its own inventory at the location.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and reflects previous stock, allowed production, sales, and waste. Unmet demand is explicitly treated as lost sales.
- There is no transshipment and lead times are zero. Labor capacity remains generous.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while handling simultaneous capacity, supply, and assortment stress without violating feasibility.
