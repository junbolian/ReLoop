Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_supply_risk
Scenario ID: retail_f4_supply_risk_v0

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer faces persistent but moderate supply risk in the middle of the season. Production capacity is reduced over a mid-horizon band of periods, and waste becomes more expensive. Demand remains exogenous and local, with no backorders and no transshipment. The retailer must decide how much to build inventory before the risk window, balancing the danger of stockouts against the risk of obsolescence and waste.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, storage, and lost sales framework is the same single-echelon structure as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- In the JSON, per-product production capacities are reduced over a specified mid-horizon band of periods, but not set to zero. Outside this band, capacities are higher and should be used to build inventory when beneficial.
- Waste cost parameters are increased for all products so that discarding inventory is more expensive, making overbuilding before the risk window more costly.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and is updated from previous stock, allowed production, sales, and waste.
- Substitution behavior, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity are unchanged from the baseline.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while trading off early inventory builds against the increased waste cost and mid-season supply risk.
