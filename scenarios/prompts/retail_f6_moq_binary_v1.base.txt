[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer faces a minimum order quantity applied uniformly across the category. In any period, the buyer must either place no order for a product or place an order that is at least as large as the specified global minimum. It is never allowed to place a small positive order below that threshold. This creates an all-or-nothing structure in procurement decisions on top of the usual inventory and storage logic.

Structure cues:
- The system is single-echelon with ordering decisions, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON specifies moq=300 in the "constraints" object. For each product, location, and period, the order quantity must either be zero or at least 300; intermediate positive quantities below moq are forbidden.
- This all-or-nothing pattern must be enforced consistently across products, locations, and periods so that the model does not exploit fractional orders below the global minimum.
- Inventory balance follows the standard pattern with zero lead time: on-hand stock in a period comes from previous stock and current orders, minus sales and waste, and cannot become negative.
- There is no transshipment; substitution behavior follows the JSON graph, and labor capacity is generous.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding, waste, lost sales, and the implicit cost of being forced to buy in minimum lots.
