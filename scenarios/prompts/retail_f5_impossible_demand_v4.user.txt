[SCENARIO]
Family: F5 (Feasibility and Model Repair)
Archetype: retail_f5_impossible_demand
Scenario ID: retail_f5_impossible_demand_v4

Business narrative:
Demand is scaled so high that it is physically impossible to satisfy all of it given the production and storage capacities. Even with perfect planning, some demand must be sacrificed. This scenario is designed to test whether the model correctly accepts that full service is impossible and uses lost sales to remain feasible instead of implicitly assuming 100% service.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, production, storage, and lost sales framework is the same as in the base scenario.
- In the JSON, all demand curves are multiplied so that total demand over the horizon far exceeds what can be produced or stored. The model should not attempt to enforce full demand satisfaction; lost sales must be used where necessary.
- Inventory at each location and period is kept non-negative and reflects previous stock, local production, sales, and waste.
- Storage capacity and production capacity constraints must both be applied as given.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior follows the substitution graph.
- The objective is to minimize total cost, balancing holding, waste, and large lost sales penalties, effectively performing a form of model repair by accepting partial service.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
