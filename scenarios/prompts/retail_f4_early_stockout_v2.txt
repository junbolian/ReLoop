You are an optimization modeling assistant specialized in retail supply chains.

Goal: semantic fidelity. The MILP must implement the structurally active mechanisms implied by `data` and the scenario text, not merely compile.

Execution contract:
- The scenario JSON is pre-loaded as a Python dict named `data`. Do NOT modify `data`.
- Do NOT perform any file I/O (no open(), json.load(), Path.read_text(), etc.).
- If the prompt includes a JSON preview, it is for reference only. Do NOT hard-code numeric constants from it.
  Always read sets/parameters from `data` at runtime.

Modeling requirements (Strict Flow Logic):
- Implement a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) in Python using gurobipy.
- **Variable Granularity:** If `shelf_life` is active, both Inventory (I) AND Sales (y) must be indexed by remaining life (a). This allows precise FIFO tracking and holding cost calculation.
- **Strict Aging Equality:** Use exact flow conservation for inventory aging: I[p,l,t+1,a] = I[p,l,t,a+1] - y[p,l,t,a+1] for a < shelf_life. 
- **Weighted Capacity:** If `cold_usage` exists for products, storage capacity constraints must use it as a coefficient: sum(I * cold_usage) <= capacity.
- **Financial Precision:** Holding costs (inv_cost) must be applied only to stock that remains after sales and will not expire in the next period (typically I - y for a >= 2).

Naming contract (required for automatic semantic checking):
- Use the following variable dictionaries with exactly these names when active:
  I (inventory by remaining life), y (sales/consumption by remaining life), W (waste),
  Q (orders), L (lost sales), d (direct demand served),
  S (substitution routing), X (transshipment), z (order trigger), n (pack integer).
- When adding constraints, set the `name=` field using these prefixes (plus indices):
  demand_route, sales_conservation, availability, expire_clear, leadtime, returns,
  init, fresh_inflow, aging, storage_cap, prod_cap, labor_cap, moq_lb, moq_ub,
  pack, budget, wastecap.

Objective (reference semantics):
- Minimize total cost including all cost terms present in `data`: holding/inventory, waste, and lost-sales penalties;
  plus purchasing/ordering costs if provided; plus (if enabled) transshipment cost and fixed ordering cost.
- If a cost term is missing in `data`, treat it as zero; do not invent extra data.

Solving and reporting contract (required for comparability):
- Set Gurobi parameters for reproducibility unless explicitly overridden by the evaluation harness:
  OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0.
  Do NOT set TimeLimit unless provided by the harness/environment.
- Always print the solver status code.
- Only treat the printed objective as "final" when status == GRB.OPTIMAL.
- If status is not GRB.OPTIMAL, also print (when available) the best incumbent objective (ObjVal),
  the best bound (ObjBound), and the MIP gap (MIPGap). Do not pretend it is optimal.

Return:
- Output a single Python script as plain text.
- No Markdown, no code fences, and no comments in the returned code.

[SCENARIO]
Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_early_stockout
Scenario ID: retail_f4_early_stockout_v2

Business narrative:
The retailer experiences an upstream supply failure at launch. For several initial periods, no production is possible for any product, but customer demand already exists at the locations. The retailer must decide how much inventory to build before the disruption and how to ration demand while supply is temporarily unavailable. Unserved demand in the disruption window is lost and penalized; customers are not backordered.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, storage, and lost sales framework matches the base scenario: single-echelon, local inventories, and no transshipment.
- In the JSON, production capacity for all products is set to zero in early periods. The model must respect this by not assigning any new production in those periods.
- Inventory remains non-negative and changes from period to period based on previous stock, any allowed production (zero during the disruption), sales, and waste.
- Storage capacity, substitution behavior, and zero lead times remain unchanged from the baseline.
- Labor capacity is generous and does not bind.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while capturing the trade-off between carrying inventory into the supply failure (and paying holding or waste costs) and accepting lost sales during the disruption.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
