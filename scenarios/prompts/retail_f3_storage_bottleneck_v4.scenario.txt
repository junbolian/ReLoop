[SCENARIO]
Family: F3 (Shared Resources and Capacity)
Archetype: retail_f3_storage_bottleneck
Scenario ID: retail_f3_storage_bottleneck_v4

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
All locations share a tight storage resource that applies across all products, representing limited chilled, ambient, or dry space. Demand at each location is still exogenous and local, and inventory is not transferred between locations. The main operational challenge is that total stored volume at each site must fit within a strict capacity, so stocking one product reduces room for others.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, production, and lost sales logic is the same as in retail_f1_base: single-echelon, multiple products and locations, local demand, and no backorders or transshipment.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. This constraint is designed to be binding and central to the trade-offs.
- Inventory levels at each location are kept non-negative and evolve from carried-over stock and new production, minus sales and waste.
- Substitution edges, if any, are taken from the JSON and follow the standard semantics: edge [A, B] means A's demand can be served by B.
- Production capacities, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity remain as in the base scenario.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting the tight storage constraint.
