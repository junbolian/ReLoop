[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Storage capacity is highly unbalanced across locations. One location acts as a high-capacity hub with ample space, while all other locations have very limited storage. Demand is still local to each location, and there is no movement of inventory between locations. The retailer must decide how much to store at each site given these asymmetric capacity limits.

Structure cues:
- The inventory system remains single-echelon with local demand at each location and no transshipment.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. The JSON concentrates storage capacity at one hub location and gives very small capacities to the satellites.
- Inventory for each product and location evolves from previous stock and local production, minus sales and waste, without ever going below zero.
- Production capacities, zero lead times, and substitution behavior are as in the base scenario.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting the highly asymmetric storage limits across locations.
