[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Storage capacity is reduced to the point where any attempt to maintain very high service levels conflicts with the physical constraints. The scenario is intended as a trap for models that implicitly assume near-perfect service without allowing lost sales: the only consistent solution is to accept that some demand will not be filled.

Structure cues:
- The inventory structure with production and storage capacity constraints is the same as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Storage capacities are scaled to 10% of normal values, making these constraints very tight.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and is updated from previous stock, production, sales, and waste.
- Unmet demand is treated as lost sales with penalties; backorders are not allowed, and there is no hard requirement that all demand be served.
- There is no transshipment and lead times are zero. Substitution behavior remains as defined.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while recognizing that limited storage capacity makes full service impossible in some periods.
