[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Storage capacity is reduced to the point where any attempt to maintain very high service levels conflicts with the physical constraints. The scenario is intended as a trap for models that implicitly assume near-perfect service without allowing lost sales: the only consistent solution is to accept that some demand will not be filled.

Structure cues:
- The inventory structure with production and storage capacity constraints is the same as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE. Use I[p,l,t,r] where r = remaining periods until expiry (1..shelf_life[p]). Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first under FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST. Key equations: (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l] where Q is total production. (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1. (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]. (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r].
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Storage capacities are scaled to 10% of normal values, making these constraints very tight.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and is updated from previous stock, production, sales, and waste.
- Unmet demand is treated as lost sales with penalties; backorders are not allowed, and there is no hard requirement that all demand be served.
- There is no transshipment and lead times are zero. Substitution behavior remains as defined.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while recognizing that limited storage capacity makes full service impossible in some periods.
