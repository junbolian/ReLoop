[SCENARIO]
Family: F7 (Network and Multi Echelon)
Archetype: retail_f7_ring_routing
Scenario ID: retail_f7_ring_routing_v0

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Locations are connected in a directed ring, mimicking a truck route that visits each location in a fixed cycle. Inventory can only move along the ring edges, and storage capacities are tightened so that the chosen routing structure affects feasibility and cost. Demand is local and exogenous at each node, and unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The transshipment network in the JSON forms a directed cycle: DC1→DC2→DC3→DC4→DC5→DC1. Inventory can be shipped only along these ring edges.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Capacities are scaled to 80% of normal values.
- For each product, location, and period, inventory reflects previous stock, local production, inbound ring shipments, outbound ring shipments, sales, and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- Demand at each location is met from local inventory and inbound ring shipments; there are no shortcuts across the ring.
- Inventory that moves further along the route must pass through intermediate locations in sequence.
- Lead times for ring shipments are effectively zero in this archetype, and substitution behavior is as encoded.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting the ring network structure and tighter storage capacities.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Network data is nested: use data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])
- IMPORTANT: sub_edges and trans_edges are lists of lists [[a,b], ...].
  Convert to tuples for Gurobi indexing: [tuple(e) for e in edges]
- Lists are 0-indexed

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Import: import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB
- Set Gurobi params: m.Params.OutputFlag = 0; m.Params.Threads = 1; m.Params.Seed = 0
- Print at end:
  print(f"status: {{m.Status}}")
  if m.Status == 2:
      print(f"objective: {{m.ObjVal}}")
- Output ONLY executable Python code. No markdown, no explanations.

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
