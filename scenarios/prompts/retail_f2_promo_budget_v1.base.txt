[SCENARIO]
Family: F2 (Assortment and Substitution)
Archetype: retail_f2_promo_budget
Scenario ID: retail_f2_promo_budget_v1

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
In the final periods of the horizon the retailer runs strong promotions on the basic and short-life products, causing their demand to spike. At the same time, an open-to-buy style budget limits how much can be spent in each period on inventory-related activities. The retailer must allocate inventory and spending over time so that promotion-induced demand is supported as well as possible without violating the budget caps.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and substitution structure is the usual single-echelon system with shared storage, production capacity, and a substitution graph, together with lost sales for unmet demand.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  DECISION VARIABLES - define EXACTLY as specified:
  - Q[p,l,t] = order quantity for product p at location l in period t
    CRITICAL: Q is indexed over (products, locations, periods), NOT just (products, periods)!
    Define as: Q = m.addVars(P, L, T, ...) NOT m.addVars(P, T, ...)
  - I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining
  - sales[p,l,t,r] = units sold from inventory cohort with r remaining life
  - W[p,l,t] = waste (expired units)
  - L[p,l,t] = lost sales (unmet demand)

  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,l,t]
      - Each location places its OWN orders. Q[p,l,t] is already per-location.
      - Do NOT multiply by demand_share. demand_share is ONLY for calculating demand values.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- In the last few periods, the JSON scales up demand for the basic and short-life products to represent promotion-induced lifts; these are treated as ordinary exogenous demands with larger magnitudes.
- The JSON also provides a per-period budget for inventory-related spending. For each period, the total purchasing spend (order quantity times purchasing cost) plus any fixed ordering costs if enabled must not exceed this budget.
- Inventory remains non-negative, and any demand that cannot be satisfied within the budget and capacity limits becomes lost sales.
- Substitution behavior, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity remain active as in other Family 2 archetypes.
- The objective is to minimize total cost subject to the per-period budget, making the trade-off between promotion support and resource limits explicit.
