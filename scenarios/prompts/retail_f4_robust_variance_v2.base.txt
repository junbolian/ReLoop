[SCENARIO]
Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_robust_variance
Scenario ID: retail_f4_robust_variance_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Demand alternates between high and low phases over the planning horizon, and lost sales are made very expensive. This mimics a robust-planning environment where the retailer must guard against demand variance rather than a single deterministic forecast. Demand is still exogenous and local at each location, with no backorders and no transshipment.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, storage, and production structure is the same single-echelon system as in the base scenario, with per-product production capacities and local inventories at each location.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- In the JSON, demand curves oscillate across periods, creating repeated high-demand and low-demand phases; lost sales penalties are increased for all products so that stockouts are very costly.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and evolves from previous stock and current production, minus sales and waste.
- Substitution behavior, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity remain in effect as in other Family 4 archetypes.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding, waste, and large lost sales penalties, encouraging robust safety-stock style planning against the demand variance.
