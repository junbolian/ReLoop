Scenario ID: retail_f7_multiechelon_chain_v1

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The network is an explicit three-echelon chain consisting of a plant, distribution centers, and retail stores. Demand occurs only at stores; the plant and distribution centers act purely as upstream nodes that hold and move inventory. Customers are never backordered: store demand that cannot be met from store inventory is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- Locations: Plant (upstream), DC1/DC2 (distribution centers), Store1/Store2/Store3 (retail). The transshipment network defines directed edges: Plant→DC1, Plant→DC2, DC1→Store1, DC1→Store2, DC2→Store2, DC2→Store3.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Capacities differ by echelon: Plant=8000, DC1/DC2=4000, Stores=600.
- Inventory is allowed to flow only along the directed edges. There is no direct shipment between stores, between distribution centers, or from stores back upstream.
- Demand occurs only at store nodes according to demand_share (Store1=30%, Store2=40%, Store3=30%). Upstream nodes (Plant, DCs) do not face direct customer demand.
- For each product, location, and period, inventory reflects previous stock, production or inbound shipments, outbound shipments, sales at stores, and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- Lost sales occur only at store nodes when local demand cannot be served from available inventory, even after receiving shipments from upstream.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding at all echelons, transshipment, waste, and lost sales, subject to the three-echelon topology.
