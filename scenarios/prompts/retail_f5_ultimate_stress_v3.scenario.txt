[SCENARIO]
Family: F5 (Feasibility and Model Repair)
Archetype: retail_f5_ultimate_stress
Scenario ID: retail_f5_ultimate_stress_v3

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
This is a composite stress test that combines three stressors: tight storage capacity, a mid-horizon production failure during a peak period, and the absence of any substitution between products. Demand is local and exogenous at each location. The scenario is designed as a boss-level test where the only viable strategy is to accept significant lost sales while respecting all physical constraints.

Structure cues:
- The archetype combines the storage bottleneck of retail_f3_storage_bottleneck (30% capacity), the peak supply failure of retail_f4_peak_failure (production=0 for periods 8-11), and the no-substitution structure of retail_f2_no_substitution (sub_edges=[]).
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  DECISION VARIABLES - define EXACTLY as specified:
  - Q[p,l,t] = order quantity for product p at location l in period t
    CRITICAL: Q is indexed over (products, locations, periods), NOT just (products, periods)!
    Define as: Q = m.addVars(P, L, T, ...) NOT m.addVars(P, T, ...)
  - I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining
  - sales[p,l,t,r] = units sold from inventory cohort with r remaining life
  - W[p,l,t] = waste (expired units)
  - L[p,l,t] = lost sales (unmet demand)

  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,l,t]
      - Each location places its OWN orders. Q[p,l,t] is already per-location.
      - Do NOT multiply by demand_share. demand_share is ONLY for calculating demand values.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. Storage capacities are scaled to 30% of normal values and must be enforced as binding constraints.
- Production capacities are set to zero during a mid-horizon peak window (periods 8-11), so no new units can be produced in those periods.
- The substitution graph is empty (sub_edges = []), so each product's demand can only be served by its own inventory at the location.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and reflects previous stock, allowed production, sales, and waste. Unmet demand is explicitly treated as lost sales.
- There is no transshipment and lead times are zero. Labor capacity remains generous.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while handling simultaneous capacity, supply, and assortment stress without violating feasibility.

[DATA ACCESS]
- The variable `data` is pre-loaded. Do NOT use file I/O.
- Lists are 0-indexed (period t in model uses index [t-1] in data arrays)

CRITICAL - Network edges require tuple conversion for Gurobi:
  sub_edges = [tuple(e) for e in data.get('network', {}).get('sub_edges', [])]
  trans_edges = [tuple(e) for e in data.get('network', {}).get('trans_edges', [])]

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Import: import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB
- Set Gurobi params: m.Params.OutputFlag = 0; m.Params.Threads = 1; m.Params.Seed = 0
- Print at end:
  print(f"status: {{m.Status}}")
  if m.Status == 2:
      print(f"objective: {{m.ObjVal}}")
- Output ONLY executable Python code. No markdown, no explanations.

[TASK]
Write a GurobiPy script that models and solves this optimization problem.
