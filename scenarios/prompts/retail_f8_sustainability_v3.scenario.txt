[SCENARIO]
Family: F8 (Omni channel and Store Operations)
Archetype: retail_f8_sustainability
Scenario ID: retail_f8_sustainability_v3

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer operates under a sustainability or regulatory constraint that limits total waste. Over the entire planning horizon, the total quantity discarded as waste must not exceed a fixed fraction of total demand. Demand is local and exogenous; unmet demand is lost and penalized. The retailer must balance serving demand, avoiding stockouts, and limiting waste.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and production structure is the same single-echelon system with storage capacity and lost sales as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON specifies waste_limit_pct=0.02 (2%). Over the horizon, the total waste across all products, locations, and periods must not exceed 2% of total demand: sum(waste) <= 0.02 * sum(demand).
- Inventory is updated from previous stock and production, minus sales and waste, and remains non-negative.
- Substitution behavior remains active as defined in the JSON, and there is no transshipment.
- The objective is to minimize total cost subject to the global waste cap, making trade-offs between holding more inventory, losing sales, and discarding units explicit.
