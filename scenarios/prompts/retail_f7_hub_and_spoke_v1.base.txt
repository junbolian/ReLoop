[SCENARIO]
Family: F7 (Network and Multi Echelon)
Archetype: retail_f7_hub_and_spoke
Scenario ID: retail_f7_hub_and_spoke_v1

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The network has one high-capacity hub distribution center that ships to several low-capacity spokes. All lateral movements must pass through the hub; spokes cannot ship directly to each other or back to the hub. Demand occurs at spokes and is local. This captures a hub-and-spoke distribution strategy where stock is pooled at the hub and then pushed out to stores.

Structure cues:
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  DECISION VARIABLES - define EXACTLY as specified:
  - Q[p,l,t] = order quantity for product p at location l in period t
    CRITICAL: Q is indexed over (products, locations, periods), NOT just (products, periods)!
    Define as: Q = m.addVars(P, L, T, ...) NOT m.addVars(P, T, ...)
  - I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining
  - sales[p,l,t,r] = units sold from inventory cohort with r remaining life
  - W[p,l,t] = waste (expired units)
  - L[p,l,t] = lost sales (unmet demand)

  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,l,t]
      - Each location places its OWN orders. Q[p,l,t] is already per-location.
      - Do NOT multiply by demand_share. demand_share is ONLY for calculating demand values.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. DC1 (hub) has capacity 50000, while other locations (spokes) have capacity 500 each.
- The transshipment network consists only of directed edges from DC1 (hub) to each spoke [DC2, DC3, DC4, DC5]. Inventory can move from the hub to the spokes but not directly between spokes and not from spokes back to the hub.
- For each product, location, and period, inventory evolves based on local production (if any), inbound shipments, outbound shipments, sales (at spokes), and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- Transshipment flows from the hub are limited by the hub's available inventory and incur transshipment costs. Spokes largely rely on inbound shipments from the hub to meet local demand.
- Lead times for transshipment are effectively zero, and substitution behavior remains as encoded.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while exploiting the centralized hub structure.
