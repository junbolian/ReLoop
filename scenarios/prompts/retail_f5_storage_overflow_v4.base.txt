[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Storage capacities are set extremely close to zero so that almost any inbound inventory risks violating capacity if not very tightly controlled. The scenario stresses whether the model correctly enforces capacity and uses waste and lost sales to maintain feasibility rather than silently overfilling locations.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and production framework is the same single-echelon system with storage constraints.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. In the JSON, cold_capacity is set to 0.5 at all locations, making this constraint extremely tight.
- Inventory must stay non-negative and is adjusted through production, sales, and waste. In most periods, on-hand inventory must be kept very low to satisfy capacity.
- Unmet demand becomes lost sales, and discarding inventory becomes an important decision despite its cost.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior is unchanged.
- The objective is to minimize total cost, trading off waste and lost sales under extremely strict storage capacity.
