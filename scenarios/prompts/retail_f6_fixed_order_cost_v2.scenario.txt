Scenario ID: retail_f6_fixed_order_cost_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Placing an order in a period incurs a fixed cost regardless of how large the order is. This encourages batching orders into fewer, larger replenishments instead of many small ones. The retailer still faces local demand, storage limits, and lost sales for unmet demand, but now each decision to place any positive order carries an additional setup-like cost.

Structure cues:
- The structure is single-echelon with ordering decisions, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON includes fixed_order=5000 in the "costs" object. Whenever a strictly positive order is placed for a product at a location in a period, this fixed cost must be charged once for that product-location-period in addition to variable purchasing costs.
- The model must ensure that the fixed cost is applied if and only if the total order quantity for a product at a location in a period is positive; it should not be possible to evade the fixed cost with arbitrarily small orders.
- Inventory balance under zero lead time is standard: on-hand stock is updated from previous stock and current orders, minus sales and waste, and cannot drop below zero.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior is unchanged.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including fixed ordering costs, holding, waste, and lost sales.
