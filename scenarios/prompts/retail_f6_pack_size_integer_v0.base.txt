[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Orders must be placed in whole packs or pallets of a fixed size. The retailer can only buy an integer number of packs; partial packs cannot be ordered. Demand and storage remain as before, and demand that cannot be served from on-hand inventory is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The system is single-echelon with ordering decisions, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE. Use I[p,l,t,r] where r = remaining periods until expiry (1..shelf_life[p]). Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first under FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST. Key equations: (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l] where Q is total production. (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1. (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]. (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r].
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON specifies pack_size=100 in the "constraints" object. In every period, the order quantity for each product at each location must be a whole number of packs (multiples of 100).
- This pack-size rule introduces integrality into order quantities and must be enforced consistently for all products and periods using the same pack size.
- Inventory balance with zero lead time is standard: on-hand stock comes from previous stock and ordered units, minus sales and waste, and remains non-negative.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior follows the JSON graph.
- The objective is to minimize total cost subject to the pack-size ordering restriction.
