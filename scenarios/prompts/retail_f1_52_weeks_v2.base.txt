[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer plans inventory over a full year of weekly decisions, represented by fifty-two time periods. Exogenous seasonal demand, local inventories at each distribution center, and per-product production capacities work as in the core operations baseline. Customers are never backordered; unmet demand in a week is immediately lost and penalized. The main difference is the extended planning horizon, which tests the ability to manage long-run seasonality and accumulation effects.

Structure cues:
- The inventory system is the same as in retail_f1_base, with multiple products, multiple locations, and capacity-limited production for each product and period.
- The time index now runs for fifty-two periods. The same inventory evolution and demand fulfillment logic is applied in every period of the year.
- At each location and for each product, stock at the end of a week depends on what was carried over, what was produced for that location during the week, and what was sold or discarded. Inventory cannot go below zero; any unmet demand in a week is lost and penalized.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- Substitution (edge [Basic, Premium] means Basic's demand can be served by Premium), the absence of transshipment, and zero lead times all remain as in the baseline case.
- Labor capacity remains high enough that it does not materially bind, though it can be represented consistently with the JSON.
- The objective is to minimize total cost over the entire year, aggregating holding, waste, and lost sales costs across all weeks.
