Archetype: retail_f8_sustainability
Scenario ID: retail_f8_sustainability_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer operates under a sustainability or regulatory constraint that limits total waste. Over the entire planning horizon, the total quantity discarded as waste must not exceed a fixed fraction of total demand. Demand is local and exogenous; unmet demand is lost and penalized. The retailer must balance serving demand, avoiding stockouts, and limiting waste.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and production structure is the same single-echelon system with storage capacity and lost sales as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON specifies waste_limit_pct=0.02 (2%). Over the horizon, the total waste across all products, locations, and periods must not exceed 2% of total demand: sum(waste) <= 0.02 * sum(demand).
- Inventory is updated from previous stock and production, minus sales and waste, and remains non-negative.
- Substitution behavior remains active as defined in the JSON, and there is no transshipment.
- The objective is to minimize total cost subject to the global waste cap, making trade-offs between holding more inventory, losing sales, and discarding units explicit.
