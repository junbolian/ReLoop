[SCENARIO]
Family: F8 (Omni channel and Store Operations)
Archetype: retail_f8_labor_constraint
Scenario ID: retail_f8_labor_constraint_v1

Business narrative:
Store and warehouse labor capacity directly limits how much inventory can be handled in each period. Labor is required for activities such as receiving, picking, and replenishment, and total labor usage per period at a location cannot exceed a location-specific cap. Demand is local and exogenous; unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory system is single-echelon with production, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- The JSON provides a labor capacity per location and period and a per-unit labor usage for each product. Total labor consumed by the relevant activities at a location in a period must not exceed this capacity.
- A simple representation is to treat labor usage as proportional to the volume of units handled, such as the sum of units received, picked, or moved for that product and period.
- Inventory balance follows the usual pattern: previous stock plus arrivals minus sales and waste, with non-negative inventory and lost sales for unmet demand.
- Storage capacity constraints remain in effect and there is no transshipment in this archetype.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting labor capacity constraints, which may bind in busy periods.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
