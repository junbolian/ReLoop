[SCENARIO]
Family: F7 (Network and Multi Echelon)
Archetype: retail_f7_multiechelon_chain
Scenario ID: retail_f7_multiechelon_chain_v1

Business narrative:
The network is an explicit three-echelon chain consisting of a plant, distribution centers, and retail stores. Demand occurs only at stores; the plant and distribution centers act purely as upstream nodes that hold and move inventory. Customers are never backordered: store demand that cannot be met from store inventory is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- Locations in the JSON include one plant, two distribution centers, and three stores. The transshipment network defines directed edges from the plant to each distribution center and from distribution centers to stores.
- Inventory is allowed to flow only along these directed edges. There is no direct shipment between stores, between distribution centers, or from stores back upstream.
- Demand occurs only at store nodes according to the demand parameters in the JSON. Upstream nodes do not face direct customer demand.
- For each product, location, and period, inventory reflects previous stock, production or inbound shipments, outbound shipments, sales at stores, and waste, and must remain non-negative.
- Storage and labor capacities differ by node type and must be enforced at each location and period.
- Lost sales occur only at store nodes when local demand cannot be served from available inventory, even after receiving shipments from upstream.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding at all echelons, transshipment, waste, and lost sales, subject to the three-echelon topology.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
