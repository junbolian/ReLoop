[SCENARIO]
Family: F7 (Network and Multi Echelon)
Archetype: retail_f7_budget_limit
Scenario ID: retail_f7_budget_limit_v2

Business narrative:
The retailer faces a per-period open-to-buy budget that limits total spending on inventory-related activities across the network. This budget must cover purchasing and possibly other variable costs, coupling decisions across locations in each period. Demand is local and exogenous, and unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The underlying network is the same single-echelon structure with potential transshipment and storage capacity as in the base network for this family.
- The JSON specifies a spending budget for each period. For that period, the total purchasing spend (order quantity times purchasing cost) plus any fixed ordering costs if enabled must not exceed the given budget.
- Inventory balance for each product, location, and period follows the standard pattern with production or inbound shipments, outbound shipments, sales, and waste, and inventory must remain non-negative.
- The budget constraint must be encoded so that spending above the budget is not allowed in any period.
- The transshipment network and lead times match the base network archetype for this family.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting the period-by-period budget caps.
