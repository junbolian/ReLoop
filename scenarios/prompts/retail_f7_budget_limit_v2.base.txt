[SCENARIO]
Family: F7 (Network and Multi Echelon)
Archetype: retail_f7_budget_limit
Scenario ID: retail_f7_budget_limit_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer faces a per-period open-to-buy budget that limits total spending on inventory-related activities across the network. This budget must cover purchasing and possibly other variable costs, coupling decisions across locations in each period. Demand is local and exogenous, and unmet demand is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The underlying network is the same single-echelon structure with potential transshipment and storage capacity as in the base network for this family.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by age (cohorts). Units produced in period t can only be held for shelf_life[p] periods; after that they expire and must be discarded as waste. Use age-indexed inventory I[p,l,t,a] with FIFO sales and automatic expiry.
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The JSON specifies budget_per_period=10000. For each period, the total purchasing spend (order quantity times purchasing cost) plus any fixed ordering costs if enabled must not exceed this budget.
- Inventory balance for each product, location, and period follows the standard pattern with production or inbound shipments, outbound shipments, sales, and waste, and inventory must remain non-negative.
- The budget constraint must be encoded so that spending above the budget is not allowed in any period.
- The transshipment network and lead times match the base network archetype for this family.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while respecting the period-by-period budget caps.
