[SCENARIO]
Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_peak_failure
Scenario ID: retail_f4_peak_failure_v2

Business narrative:
An upstream supply failure occurs during a high-demand peak, such as a holiday season. Production capacity drops to zero only during the peak window, while demand for all products remains high. The retailer must build inventory before the peak, use it strategically during the failure, and accept some lost sales if necessary. Demand that cannot be served in the peak periods is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, storage, and lost sales structure is the same as in the base scenario.
- In the JSON, production capacities are set to zero only during a mid-horizon block of periods that coincide with the demand peak. No new production can occur in those periods.
- Inventory at each location remains non-negative and is updated from period to period based on earlier production, sales, and waste.
- Substitution behavior, absence of transshipment, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity all remain in effect.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while planning around the temporary but strategically placed supply failure.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
