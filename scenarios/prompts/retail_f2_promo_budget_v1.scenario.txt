[SCENARIO]
Family: F2 (Assortment and Substitution)
Archetype: retail_f2_promo_budget
Scenario ID: retail_f2_promo_budget_v1

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
In the final periods of the horizon the retailer runs strong promotions on the basic and short-life products, causing their demand to spike. At the same time, an open-to-buy style budget limits how much can be spent in each period on inventory-related activities. The retailer must allocate inventory and spending over time so that promotion-induced demand is supported as well as possible without violating the budget caps.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and substitution structure is the usual single-echelon system with shared storage, production capacity, and a substitution graph, together with lost sales for unmet demand.
- In the last few periods, the JSON scales up demand for the basic and short-life products to represent promotion-induced lifts; these are treated as ordinary exogenous demands with larger magnitudes.
- The JSON also provides a per-period budget for inventory-related spending. For each period, the total purchasing spend (order quantity times purchasing cost) plus any fixed ordering costs if enabled must not exceed this budget.
- Inventory remains non-negative, and any demand that cannot be satisfied within the budget and capacity limits becomes lost sales.
- Storage capacity, substitution behavior, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity remain active as in other Family 2 archetypes.
- The objective is to minimize total cost subject to the per-period budget, making the trade-off between promotion support and resource limits explicit.
