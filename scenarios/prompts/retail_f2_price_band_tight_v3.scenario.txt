[SCENARIO]
Family: F2 (Assortment and Substitution)
Archetype: retail_f2_price_band_tight
Scenario ID: retail_f2_price_band_tight_v3

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer operates a category with a value-oriented basic product and a premium product that are sold under tight price bands and margin trade-offs. Premium carries higher effective margin and stricter implicit service expectations, while basic is cheaper but more price sensitive. When Basic inventory is insufficient, Basic's demand can be served by Premium (upward substitution); the reverse does not occur. Unmet demand after this limited upgrade behavior is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The physical and inventory structure follows the same pattern as in retail_f1_base: single-echelon, local demand, local inventory, shared storage, and no transshipment.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- The substitution graph contains a single directed edge [Basic, Premium]. This means: when Basic inventory is insufficient, Premium inventory can serve Basic's demand. S[Basic, Premium] represents units of Basic's demand fulfilled by Premium.
- Lost sales penalties and purchasing or production costs in the JSON make premium more valuable to protect and basic cheaper but more elastic. This asymmetry is expressed through cost parameters, not through any special-case constraints.
- Inventory remains non-negative; any demand that cannot be satisfied even after allowing the basic-to-premium substitution is recorded as lost sales.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are effectively zero, and labor capacity is non-binding.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding, waste, and lost sales while respecting the one-way substitution rule and storage capacity limits.
