[SCENARIO]
Family: F5 (Feasibility and Model Repair)
Archetype: retail_f5_impossible_demand
Scenario ID: retail_f5_impossible_demand_v1

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
Demand is scaled so high that it is physically impossible to satisfy all of it given the production and storage capacities. Even with perfect planning, some demand must be sacrificed. This scenario is designed to test whether the model correctly accepts that full service is impossible and uses lost sales to remain feasible instead of implicitly assuming 100% service.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, production, storage, and lost sales framework is the same as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- In the JSON, all demand curves are multiplied by 5x so that total demand over the horizon far exceeds what can be produced or stored. The model should not attempt to enforce full demand satisfaction; lost sales must be used where necessary.
- Inventory at each location and period is kept non-negative and reflects previous stock, local production, sales, and waste.
- Production capacity constraints must be applied as given.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior follows the substitution graph.
- The objective is to minimize total cost, balancing holding, waste, and large lost sales penalties, effectively performing a form of model repair by accepting partial service.
