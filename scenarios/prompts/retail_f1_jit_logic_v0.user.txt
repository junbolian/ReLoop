[SCENARIO]
Family: F1 (Core Operations)
Archetype: retail_f1_jit_logic
Scenario ID: retail_f1_jit_logic_v0

Business narrative:
This scenario represents a just-in-time regime where holding inventory is very expensive. The retailer still faces exogenous seasonal demand at each location, cannot backorder customers, and has limited per-product production capacity per period. Because holding costs are high, the retailer is incentivized to keep inventories as lean as possible while still avoiding excessive lost sales.

Structure cues:
- The physical network and decision timing are the same as in retail_f1_base: single-echelon, multi-product, multi-location, with local demand and local inventory.
- Inventory at each location carries over from the previous period, is increased by local production that arrives without delay, and is reduced by sales and any intentional waste. Stock levels must remain non-negative, and any demand in excess of available stock is treated as lost sales.
- Storage capacity constraints, substitution behavior, and the absence of transshipment all match the baseline archetype.
- Holding cost coefficients in the JSON are scaled up substantially compared with retail_f1_base, making on-hand inventory much more expensive relative to lost sales. The underlying constraint structure is unchanged.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding, waste, and lost sales, with the higher holding cost forcing a just-in-time style of operation.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).



[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Sets reproducibility parameters (OutputFlag=0, Threads=1, Seed=0) unless the harness overrides them,
5) Prints: status always; objective only as final if OPTIMAL; otherwise also print ObjVal/ObjBound/MIPGap when available.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
