[SCENARIO]
Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_peak_failure
Scenario ID: retail_f4_peak_failure_v1

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
An upstream supply failure occurs during a high-demand peak, such as a holiday season. Production capacity drops to zero only during the peak window, while demand for all products remains high. The retailer must build inventory before the peak, use it strategically during the failure, and accept some lost sales if necessary. Demand that cannot be served in the peak periods is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, storage, and lost sales structure is the same as in the base scenario.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- In the JSON, production capacities are set to zero only during a mid-horizon block of periods that coincide with the demand peak. No new production can occur in those periods.
- Inventory at each location remains non-negative and is updated from period to period based on earlier production, sales, and waste.
- Substitution behavior, absence of transshipment, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity all remain in effect.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while planning around the temporary but strategically placed supply failure.
