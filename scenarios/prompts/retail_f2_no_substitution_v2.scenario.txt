[SCENARIO]
Family: F2 (Assortment and Substitution)
Archetype: retail_f2_no_substitution
Scenario ID: retail_f2_no_substitution_v2

[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]
Business narrative:
The retailer manages multiple products that do not substitute for each other. Customers either buy the specific product they requested or, if it is unavailable, do not purchase anything and generate a lost sale. Demand for each product at each location is exogenous and seasonal. Inventory is held locally with no transshipment and no backorders, and there is no cross-product switching under any circumstances.

Structure cues:
- The physical setup matches retail_f1_base: single-echelon, multi-product, multi-location, with inventory held only at the locations that serve final demand.
- Inventory at each location and period starts from the previous period's ending stock, is increased by local production or procurement, and is decreased by sales and waste. Stock cannot become negative.
- Shelf life: Each product has a shelf life in periods. Inventory must be tracked by REMAINING LIFE.

  VARIABLE DEFINITION: I[p,l,t,r] = inventory at START of period t with r periods remaining.
  Convention: r=1 is OLDEST (sell first FIFO), r=shelf_life[p] is FRESHEST.

  KEY EQUATIONS - implement EXACTLY as written, do NOT add or remove terms:

  (1) Fresh inflow: I[p,l,t,SL] = Q[p,t] * demand_share[l]
      - This is ONLY the inflow from production. Do NOT subtract sales here!
      - Q is total production, demand_share distributes it to locations.

  (2) Aging: I[p,l,t+1,r] = I[p,l,t,r+1] - sales[p,l,t,r+1] for r=1..SL-1
      - Inventory tomorrow with r remaining = inventory today with r+1 remaining - sales

  (3) Waste: W[p,l,t] = I[p,l,t,1] - sales[p,l,t,1]
      - Items with r=1 that aren't sold become waste

  (4) Sales availability: sales[p,l,t,r] <= I[p,l,t,r]
      - Can only sell what you have in inventory

  (5) Inventory holding cost: charged on (I[p,l,t,r] - sales[p,l,t,r]) for r >= 2
      - Charge on END-of-period inventory (after sales), exclude expiring items (r=1)
- Storage capacity: sum over products of (cold_usage[p] * total_inventory[p,l,t]) <= cold_capacity[l]. These limits must be respected.
- In this archetype, the substitution graph in the JSON is empty (sub_edges = []). The model must not allow demand for one product to be satisfied by any other product; each product's demand can only be met by its own on-hand inventory at that location.
- There is no transshipment of inventory between locations, lead times are effectively zero, and labor capacity is large relative to demand.
- The objective is to minimize total cost including holding, waste, and lost sales without any cross-product substitution logic.
