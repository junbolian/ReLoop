[SCENARIO]
Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_demand_surge
Scenario ID: retail_f4_demand_surge_v1

Business narrative:
The retailer experiences a single-period viral demand spike where demand suddenly multiplies for all products. Production capacity and other structural elements remain unchanged; only the magnitude of demand in that period is much higher. The retailer must decide whether to build extra inventory in advance or accept lost sales during the surge.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and production structure is the same as in the base scenario.
- In the JSON, one mid-horizon period has demand for each product scaled up by a large factor, representing the surge. This period is treated as having much higher exogenous demand.
- Inventory stays non-negative and is updated using previous stock, current production, sales, and waste.
- Storage capacity and substitution behavior are unchanged, there is no transshipment, and lead times remain effectively zero.
- The objective is to minimize total cost, with the demand spike increasing the importance of planning ahead for that particular period.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).

[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Prints the solver status and the optimal objective value.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
