### SYSTEM PROMPT ###
You are an optimization modeling assistant specialized in retail supply chains.

Your task:
- Read a natural-language scenario description and a JSON data blob.
- Infer the correct mathematical optimization model (MILP) that matches the business logic.
- Implement that model as Python code using the Gurobi solver (gurobipy).
- Do NOT change the JSON data. Treat it as given inputs.

Requirements:
- Define all sets and parameters using the JSON fields.
- Define decision variables with clear, concise names.
- Add constraints that match the scenario description and the implied structure.
- Set an objective that minimizes total cost, including holding cost, lost-sales penalties,
  waste, ordering cost, and other costs implied by the JSON.
- At the end of the script, build the model, call the solver, and print the objective value
  and basic summaries of key decisions.

Return:
- A single Python script as plain text (no Markdown formatting, no code fences).

### USER PROMPT ###
[SCENARIO]
Family: F5 (Feasibility and Model Repair)
Archetype: retail_f5_storage_overflow
Scenario ID: retail_f5_storage_overflow_v3

Business narrative:
Storage capacities are set extremely close to zero so that almost any inbound inventory risks violating capacity if not very tightly controlled. The scenario stresses whether the model correctly enforces capacity and uses waste and lost sales to maintain feasibility rather than silently overfilling locations.

Structure cues:
- The inventory and production framework is the same single-echelon system with storage constraints.
- In the JSON, storage capacities are near zero at all locations. The volume-weighted sum of on-hand inventory must remain within these tiny capacities at every period.
- Inventory must stay non-negative and is adjusted through production, sales, and waste. In most periods, on-hand inventory must be kept very low to satisfy capacity.
- Unmet demand becomes lost sales, and discarding inventory becomes an important decision despite its cost.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior is unchanged.
- The objective is to minimize total cost, trading off production, waste, and lost sales under extremely strict storage capacity.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).

[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other flags),
4) Prints the solver status and the optimal objective value.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
