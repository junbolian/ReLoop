### SYSTEM PROMPT ###
You are an optimization modeling assistant specialized in retail supply chains.

Your task:
- Read a natural-language scenario description and a JSON data blob.
- Infer the correct mathematical optimization model (MILP) that matches the business logic.
- Implement that model as Python code using the Gurobi solver (gurobipy).
- Do NOT change the JSON data. Treat it as given inputs.

Requirements:
- Define all sets and parameters using the JSON fields.
- Define decision variables with clear, concise names.
- Add constraints that match the scenario description and the implied structure.
- Set an objective that minimizes total cost, including holding cost, lost-sales penalties,
  waste, ordering cost, and other costs implied by the JSON.
- At the end of the script, build the model, call the solver, and print the objective value
  and basic summaries of key decisions.

Return:
- A single Python script as plain text (no Markdown formatting, no code fences).

### USER PROMPT ###
[SCENARIO]
Family: F5 (Feasibility and Model Repair)
Archetype: retail_f5_strict_service_trap
Scenario ID: retail_f5_strict_service_trap_v4

Business narrative:
Storage capacity is reduced to the point where any attempt to maintain very high service levels conflicts with the physical constraints. The scenario is intended as a trap for models that implicitly assume near-perfect service without allowing lost sales: the only consistent solution is to accept that some demand will not be filled.

Structure cues:
- The inventory structure with production and storage capacity constraints is the same as in the base scenario.
- Storage capacities at all locations are sharply scaled down in the JSON. These tighter capacities must be enforced when limiting on-hand inventory.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and is updated from previous stock, production, sales, and waste.
- Unmet demand is treated as lost sales with penalties; backorders are not allowed, and there is no hard requirement that all demand be served.
- There is no transshipment and lead times are zero. Substitution behavior remains as defined.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while recognizing that limited storage capacity makes full service impossible in some periods.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values.

[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other flags),
4) Prints the solver status and the optimal objective value.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
