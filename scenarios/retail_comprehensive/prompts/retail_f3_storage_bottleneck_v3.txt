### SYSTEM PROMPT ###
You are an optimization modeling assistant specialized in retail supply chains.

Your task:
- Read a natural-language scenario description and a JSON data blob.
- Infer the correct mathematical optimization model (MILP) that matches the business logic.
- Implement that model as Python code using the Gurobi solver (gurobipy).
- Do NOT change the JSON data. Treat it as given inputs.

Requirements:
- Define all sets and parameters using the JSON fields.
- Define decision variables with clear, concise names.
- Add constraints that match the scenario description and the implied structure.
- Set an objective that minimizes total cost, including holding cost, lost-sales penalties,
  waste, ordering cost, and other costs implied by the JSON.
- At the end of the script, build the model, call the solver, and print the objective value
  and basic summaries of key decisions.

Return:
- A single Python script as plain text (no Markdown formatting, no code fences).

### USER PROMPT ###
[SCENARIO]
Family: F3 (Shared Resources and Capacity)
Archetype: retail_f3_storage_bottleneck
Scenario ID: retail_f3_storage_bottleneck_v3

Business narrative:
All locations share a tight storage resource that applies across all products, representing limited chilled, ambient, or dry space. Demand at each location is still exogenous and local, and inventory is not transferred between locations. The main operational challenge is that total stored volume at each site must fit within a strict capacity, so stocking one product reduces room for others.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, production, and lost sales logic is the same as in retail_f1_base: single-echelon, multiple products and locations, local demand, and no backorders or transshipment.
- At every location and period, a single shared storage capacity constraint limits the volume-weighted sum of on-hand inventory across all products using product-specific storage usage and the location capacity from the JSON.
- Inventory levels at each location are kept non-negative and evolve from carried-over stock and new production, minus sales and waste.
- Substitution edges, if any, are taken from the JSON but are not altered by this archetype.
- Production capacities, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity remain as in the base scenario.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while the shared storage constraint is designed to be binding and thus central to the trade-offs.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values.

[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other flags),
4) Prints the solver status and the optimal objective value.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
