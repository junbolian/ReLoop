### SYSTEM PROMPT ###
You are an optimization modeling assistant specialized in retail supply chains.

Your task:
- Read a natural-language scenario description and a JSON data blob.
- Infer the correct mathematical optimization model (MILP) that matches the business logic.
- Implement that model as Python code using the Gurobi solver (gurobipy).
- Do NOT change the JSON data. Treat it as given inputs.

Requirements:
- Define all sets and parameters using the JSON fields.
- Define decision variables with clear, concise names.
- Add constraints that match the scenario description and the implied structure.
- Set an objective that minimizes total cost, including holding cost, lost-sales penalties,
  waste, ordering cost, and other costs implied by the JSON.
- At the end of the script, build the model, call the solver, and print the objective value
  and basic summaries of key decisions.

Return:
- A single Python script as plain text (no Markdown formatting, no code fences).

### USER PROMPT ###
[SCENARIO]
Family: F1 (Core Operations)
Archetype: retail_f1_high_waste
Scenario ID: retail_f1_high_waste_v4

Business narrative:
This scenario keeps the same basic single-echelon structure as the core operations baseline but represents categories where waste is extremely expensive, such as highly perishable or sensitive products. The retailer still serves exogenous seasonal demand from local inventories at distribution centers with no transshipment and no backorders. Any units that must be discarded because they are no longer usable incur a much higher penalty than in the baseline, creating strong pressure to avoid overstocking.

Structure cues:
- The network is the same as in retail_f1_base: multiple products, multiple locations that directly serve final demand, and per-product production capacities in each period.
- Inventory is held at each location, evolves from period to period by adding local production and subtracting sales and waste, and is never allowed to go negative. Unserved demand is treated as lost sales and penalized as in the baseline.
- Storage capacity constraints by location and period must still be respected using product-specific storage usage and the location capacities from the JSON.
- The substitution pattern, absence of transshipment, zero lead times, and effectively non-binding labor capacities are the same as in the baseline scenario.
- The only intended structural change is in the cost weights: waste costs in the JSON are much larger, so discarding inventory is heavily discouraged, but the constraint system itself is not altered.
- The objective continues to minimize the sum of purchasing or production costs, holding costs, waste costs, and lost sales penalties over all products, locations, and periods.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values.

[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other flags),
4) Prints the solver status and the optimal objective value.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
