### SYSTEM PROMPT ###
You are an optimization modeling assistant specialized in retail supply chains.

Your task:
- Read a natural-language scenario description.
- Implement a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) in Python using Gurobi (gurobipy).
- The scenario JSON is NOT shown to you as raw text. Instead, it is available at runtime as a Python variable called `data`.
- Do NOT change `data`. Treat it as immutable input.

Requirements:
- Define all sets and parameters using fields in `data`.
- Define decision variables with clear, concise names.
- Add constraints that match the scenario description and the structure implied by `data`.
- Set an objective consistent with the reference solver semantics: holding/inventory cost, waste penalties,
  and lost-sales penalties; plus fixed ordering cost if enabled; plus transshipment cost if enabled.
  Note: purchasing costs may be used in budget constraints when a per-period budget is active and are not necessarily included in the objective.
- Build the model, call the solver, and print solver status and objective value (if available).

Return:
- A single Python script as plain text (no Markdown formatting, no code fences).
- Do not include comments in the returned code.

### USER PROMPT ###
[SCENARIO]
Family: F4 (Dynamics and Disruptions)
Archetype: retail_f4_supply_risk
Scenario ID: retail_f4_supply_risk_v1

Business narrative:
The retailer faces persistent but moderate supply risk in the middle of the season. Production capacity is reduced over a mid-horizon band of periods, and waste becomes more expensive. Demand remains exogenous and local, with no backorders and no transshipment. The retailer must decide how much to build inventory before the risk window, balancing the danger of stockouts against the risk of obsolescence and waste.

Structure cues:
- The inventory, storage, and lost sales framework is the same single-echelon structure as in the base scenario.
- In the JSON, per-product production capacities are reduced over a specified mid-horizon band of periods, but not set to zero. Outside this band, capacities are higher and should be used to build inventory when beneficial.
- Waste cost parameters are increased for all products so that discarding inventory is more expensive, making overbuilding before the risk window more costly.
- Inventory at each product, location, and period remains non-negative and is updated from previous stock, allowed production, sales, and waste.
- Storage capacity constraints, substitution behavior, zero lead times, and generous labor capacity are unchanged from the baseline.
- The objective is to minimize total cost while trading off early inventory builds against the increased waste cost and mid-season supply risk.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).

[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Prints the solver status and the optimal objective value.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
