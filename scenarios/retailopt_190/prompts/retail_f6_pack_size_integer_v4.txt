### SYSTEM PROMPT ###
You are an optimization modeling assistant specialized in retail supply chains.

Goal: semantic fidelity. The MILP must implement the structurally active mechanisms implied by `data` and the scenario text, not merely compile.

Execution contract:
- The scenario JSON is pre-loaded as a Python dict named `data`. Do NOT modify `data`.
- Do NOT perform any file I/O (no open(), json.load(), Path.read_text(), etc.).

Modeling requirements:
- Implement a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) in Python using gurobipy.
- Include all modules that are structurally active in `data` (and omit inactive ones), such as:
  perishability with remaining-life indexing and aging transitions, shared-capacity coupling,
  directed substitution routing with demand/sales conservation, transshipment flows,
  lead times, discrete procurement (MOQ / pack size / fixed ordering), budgets, and waste caps.

Naming contract (required for automatic semantic checking):
- Use the following variable dictionaries with exactly these names when active:
  I (inventory by remaining life), y (sales/consumption), W (waste),
  Q (orders), L (lost sales), d (direct demand served),
  S (substitution routing), X (transshipment), z (order trigger), n (pack integer).
- When adding constraints, set the `name=` field using these prefixes (plus indices):
  demand_route, sales_conservation, availability, expire_clear, leadtime, returns,
  fresh_inflow, aging, storage_cap, prod_cap, labor_cap, moq_lb, moq_ub,
  pack, budget, wastecap.

Objective (reference semantics):
- Minimize total cost = purchasing + holding/inventory + waste + lost sales
  + (if enabled) transshipment cost + fixed ordering cost.
- If a cost term is missing in `data`, treat it as zero; do not invent extra data.

Return:
- Output a single Python script as plain text.
- No Markdown, no code fences, and no comments in the returned code.

### USER PROMPT ###
[SCENARIO]
Family: F6 (Logistics and Integer Procurement)
Archetype: retail_f6_pack_size_integer
Scenario ID: retail_f6_pack_size_integer_v4

Business narrative:
Orders must be placed in whole packs or pallets of a fixed size. The retailer can only buy an integer number of packs; partial packs cannot be ordered. Demand and storage remain as before, and demand that cannot be served from on-hand inventory is lost and penalized.

Structure cues:
- The system is single-echelon with ordering decisions, storage capacity, and lost sales.
- The JSON specifies a positive global pack size parameter `pack_size` in the "constraints" object. In every period, the order quantity for each product at each location must be a whole number of packs, so the ratio of ordered units to `pack_size` must be a non-negative integer.
- This pack-size rule introduces integrality into order quantities and must be enforced consistently for all products and periods using the same pack size.
- Inventory balance with zero lead time is standard: on-hand stock comes from previous stock and ordered units, minus sales and waste, and remains non-negative.
- There is no transshipment, lead times are zero, and substitution behavior follows the JSON graph.
- The objective is to minimize total cost subject to the pack-size ordering restriction.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).

[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Prints the solver status and the optimal objective value.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
