### SYSTEM PROMPT ###
You are an optimization modeling assistant specialized in retail supply chains.

Your task:
- Read a natural-language scenario description.
- Implement a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) in Python using Gurobi (gurobipy).
- The scenario JSON is NOT shown to you as raw text. Instead, it is available at runtime as a Python variable called `data`.
- Do NOT change `data`. Treat it as immutable input.

Requirements:
- Define all sets and parameters using fields in `data`.
- Define decision variables with clear, concise names.
- Add constraints that match the scenario description and the structure implied by `data`.
- Set an objective consistent with the reference solver semantics: holding/inventory cost, waste penalties,
  and lost-sales penalties; plus fixed ordering cost if enabled; plus transshipment cost if enabled.
  Note: purchasing costs may be used in budget constraints when a per-period budget is active and are not necessarily included in the objective.
- Build the model, call the solver, and print solver status and objective value (if available).

Return:
- A single Python script as plain text (no Markdown formatting, no code fences).
- Do not include comments in the returned code.

### USER PROMPT ###
[SCENARIO]
Family: F1 (Core Operations)
Archetype: retail_f1_high_waste
Scenario ID: retail_f1_high_waste_v3

Business narrative:
This scenario keeps the same basic single-echelon structure as the core operations baseline but represents categories where waste is extremely expensive, such as highly perishable or sensitive products. The retailer still serves exogenous seasonal demand from local inventories at distribution centers with no transshipment and no backorders. Any units that must be discarded because they are no longer usable incur a much higher penalty than in the baseline, creating strong pressure to avoid overstocking.

Structure cues:
- The network is the same as in retail_f1_base: multiple products, multiple locations that directly serve final demand, and per-product production capacities in each period.
- Inventory is held at each location, evolves from period to period by adding local production and subtracting sales and waste, and is never allowed to go negative. Unserved demand is treated as lost sales and penalized as in the baseline.
- Storage capacity constraints by location and period must still be respected using product-specific storage usage and the location capacities from the JSON.
- The substitution pattern, absence of transshipment, zero lead times, and effectively non-binding labor capacities are the same as in the baseline scenario.
- The only intended structural change is in the cost weights: waste costs in the JSON are much larger, so discarding inventory is heavily discouraged, but the constraint system itself is not altered.
- The objective continues to minimize the sum of holding costs, waste costs, and lost sales penalties over all products, locations, and periods.

Operational context:
- The JSON contains the number of time periods, the list of products, and the list of locations
  directly as top-level fields (for example: "periods", "products", "locations").
- Cost parameters such as holding, lost-sales, waste, purchasing, and any fixed ordering costs
  are stored in the "costs" section of the JSON.
- Capacity and operational limits such as storage capacity, production capacity, labor capacity,
  shelf life, lead times, minimum order quantities, pack sizes, and any waste or budget limits
  are stored in fields such as "cold_capacity", "production_cap", "labor_cap", "shelf_life",
  "lead_time", "constraints", and "network".
- Scenario-level control parameters such as global minimum order quantities, pack sizes, fixed
  ordering costs, per-period budgets, and waste caps are provided as scalar fields inside the
  "constraints" and "costs" sections and should be applied uniformly across products and locations
  unless the scenario description explicitly specifies otherwise.
- Substitution and transshipment structures are encoded in the "network" section, for example
  as substitution edges or transshipment edges between locations.
- The model should respect all of these fields exactly as given and interpret them in a way
  consistent with the scenario description.

JSON data (do not modify):
The evaluation harness loads the JSON for this scenario into a Python variable
called `data`. Your code should read all sets and parameters from `data` using
these fields and must not change any numeric values or perform any file I/O
(for example, do not call open or json.load).

[INSTRUCTION]
Using ONLY the information above, write a complete Python script that:

1) Imports gurobipy (import gurobipy as gp; from gurobipy import GRB),
2) Assumes the JSON has already been loaded into a Python variable called `data`,
3) Builds and solves a mixed-integer linear program that reflects the business
   description and the structure implied by the JSON fields (including capacities,
   shelf life, lead times, substitution edges, transshipment edges, and other keys/conditions present in `data`),
4) Prints the solver status and the optimal objective value.

Do not invent extra data. Do not change any numbers from the JSON.
Return ONLY the Python source code as plain text, with no comments and no Markdown.
